;<KCC.C>EXPORT.DOC.1,  9-Aug-85 18:46:22, Edit by KRONJ

Files needed for a working copy of KCC (all on Sierra):

	SYS:CC.EXE		The compiler itself
	PS:<KCC.C>*.*		Runtimes and include files
	PS:<KCC.C.SYS>*.*	More include files

You should define C: to point to <KCC.C> or wherever you put those files.
The files in <KCC.C.SYS> should be in a subdirectory of C:, so that
#include <sys/file.h> can work.


Sources:
	PS:<KCC.CC>*.*		The compiler
	PS:<KCC.LIB>*.*		Runtimes (and copies of include files)

These are for the latest test version, and may not be in a working state.
*.*.-2 may be slightly out of date but will always correspond with some
installed version.


Other files:
	PS:<KCC.BENCH>*.*	The benchmark used by the Stanford MIPS project
	PS:<KCC.FAIL>*.*	A copy of the assembler with some bugfixes
	PS:<KCC.UNIX*>*.*	Programs ported from UNIX.  You must have
				a UNIX source license to use these files;
				contact the staff for details.
