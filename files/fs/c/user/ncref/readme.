This directory contains the programs for the function cross-reference
program.  They have been adjusted to work with both pr and list as far
as line counts are concerned.
	crdef.c
	crsubs.c
	cxdef.c
	ncref.c
	parses.c
	run
These are versions of pr and list who put the same number of lines
per page as ncref is used to.
	list.c
	pr.c    Has new options of -i -f and -n which are very
		useful.
NOTE: crdef.c is really a ".h" file, included from ncref.c...kck
