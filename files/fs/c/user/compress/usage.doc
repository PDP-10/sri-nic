 * Usage: compress [-dfvc] [-b bits] [file ...]
 * Inputs:
 *	-d:	    If given, decompression is done instead.
 *
 *      -c:         Write output on stdout, don't remove original.
 *
 *      -b:         Parameter limits the max number of bits/code.
 *
 *	-f:	    Forces output file to be generated, even if one already
 *		    exists, and even if no space is saved by compressing.
 *		    If -f is not used, the user will be prompted if stdin is
 *		    a tty, otherwise, the output file will not be overwritten.
 *
 *      -v:	    Write compression statistics
 *
 * 	file ...:   Files to be compressed.  If none specified, stdin
 *		    is used.
 * Outputs:
 *	file.Z:	    Compressed form of file with same mode, owner, and utimes
 * 	or stdout   (if stdin used as input)
 *
 * Assumptions:
 *	When filenames are given, replaces with the compressed version
 *	(.Z suffix) only if the file decreases in size.
