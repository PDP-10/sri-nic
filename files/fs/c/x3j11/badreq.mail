Subject: ANSI request for clarification.
Date: Mon, 05 Jun 89 15:17:49 -0400

   There has been much discussion of "Miranda Rules" for function
argument behavior in the absence of prototypes.  As I understand it,
a function call can be thought of as causing a prototype
to be built that corresponds to widened actual argument types. What
has been implied in non-ANSI literature is that the "Miranda" prototype is
constructed for the initial reference and retained for the rest of the
file.
  My understanding of ANSI function prototyping is that, for
non-prototyped functions, a prototype is constructed anew for each function call.
  This is actually a request from Larry Rosenthal who doesn not have
access to this mailing list.

  Thanks,
  Pete Darnell

.X3 89-051  "Administrative notices" "06 Jun 89"
.LP
Jim Brodie, P J Plauger, and I are still trying to determine the
exact state of affairs with our X3 approval.
We have finally decided to send out this mailing without
a full status report;
that will have to wait for another mailing soon.
.LP
Very briefly, everything is still in the X3 office in Washington.
Our understanding is that Mr Hansberry has asked for a full formal
appeal process.
We will send further information as it becomes available.
.LP
Please do not inundate us with telephone calls asking what
news we have next week.
We are attempting to create a quick-notification network,
and will also send another mailing soon.
.LP
Potentially helpful things for the next stages:
.IP o
If you have not already done so,
please try to obtain access to an e-mail facility that can be
reached through Usenet.
.IP o
If you have information about "portal" services which can connect
Usenet to other existing networks, please telephone me
or send email to plum@PLUMHALL.UU.NET .
.IP o
If you have a new or changed net-address to report,
please send email to Ken Harrenstien, klh@SRI-NIC.ARPA .
.IP o
I would very much appreciate the services of a volunteer to
integrate the ordinary-mail mailing list with the Usenet list.
That is, if every voting member of the committee either
had a net-address, or had someone with a net-address willing
to send quick photocopies,
we would be better prepared for our next phases.
If you can help with this please contact me.
.IP o
If, on the other hand,
you have a net-address but already know that it would be unrealistic
for you to make copies of your mail for a few other members,
please let me know via email.
.LP
Our thanks to everyone who has worked so long and hard on this project.
We will keep you posted.

Hello, I received your confirmation of my message of few months back.
I duly sent back the confirmation you asked me for.
I never received anything after that first message, although messages
seem to have gone out. At least, that is what Rex Jaeschke tells me.

What happened?

INFORMATION PROCESSING SYSTEMS              Doc No: X3J11/89-054

                                            Reply to: Thomas Plum

                Status______ of__ X3J11_____ Proposed________ Standard________

The following information comes from telephone conversations with
Marilyn  Kornfeld,  Manager  of Projects and Standards, X3 Secre-
tariat:

     In April, Mr Russell Hansberry filed a 27-page appeal to the
     X3  Secretariat.  The appeal deals with procedural questions
     and contains threats of legal  actions.   The  Secretariat's
     lawyers  have  recommended  that  the Secretariat not send a
     copy to X3J11, or at least not yet.

     Mr Hansberry appealed the X3 procedure that allowed him only
     30  days  to  file  his  appeal.  A decision was made at the
     Secretariat to allow him until 1 July to draft his  detailed
     appeal.

The operative procedure here is Section 11 (Appeals Procedure) in
X3/SD-2 (Organization and Procedures):

     The Secretariat must respond to the appeal within  30  days,
     i.e. by 1 August.

     If, after that, the appellant and the Secretariat are unable
     to  resolve  the  complaint, the Secretariat "shall" [must?]
     schedule an three-person  appeals  panel:  one  selected  by
     appellant,  one  by  Secretariat, one jointly.  There are no
     mandated time limits on the panel selection.

     The panel shall render a decision in 30 days.  Section  11.5
     indicates that further appeals may be made to ANSI.

Plum has communicated the following question to the  Secretariat:
What  criteria does the Secretariat follow in determining whether
to grant an appeals panel to an appellant?

X3J11 members from organizations with X3 representation will pro-
bably want to discuss this situation with their representative.

Brodie summarized X3J11's position in his cover letter 89-028: Mr
Hansberry  received  a  fair  hearing,  and the committee did not
adopt any of his proposals.

89-055 PRELIMINARY DRAFT #1
04 Jul 1989
Current status of X3J11 standard

Thomas Plum  609-927-3770 Plum Hall Inc
1 Spruce Av, Cardiff NJ 08232 USA
uunet!plumhall!plum  OR  plum@PLUMHALL.UU.NET

On 29 June, X3 received an 8(?)-page addendum from Russell Hansberry,
adding to the 26-page appeal received previously.  Copies of both
documents are being expressed to X3J11 officers, to be received
Wednesday 05 July.

There will be an all-day meeting at the X3 Secretariat Friday 07 July,
with officers from J11, X3, SPARC (Standards Planning and Requirements
Committee), and SMC (Secretariat Management Committee).  J11 will be
represented by Plauger (Secretary) and Plum (Vice-Chair).  Brodie
(Chair) concurs with this representation.

We have been asked to provide a chronology of J11's interactions with
Hansberry.  I believe he makes a claim that he did not receive an
adequate hearing.  Therefore, the e-mail distribution of this paper
is accompanied by my rough draft of the chronology (89-056.1).  The main
focus is "Who talked with Hansberry, and for how long?".

Three requests:

(1) Please check this chronology for accuracy and completeness; it needs
more details.  By noon Thursday (06 July), please e-mail or phone with
any changes for the chronology.

(2) (Referring to 89-052, the list of current voting members) If you
know of someone in your local region, who does not receive e-mail, and
was involved in this chronology, please telephone them to see if they
can add any details.

(3) If your company has X3 representation, please discuss this
upcoming Friday meeting with your X3 representative.  If they feel that
it is appropriate, suggest that they telephone any of the X3, SPARC, or
SMC Chair or Vice-Chair people, so that they have some sense of how
their constituents feel about this Hansberry delay.

The officers of J11 believe that an overwhelming consensus of J11
desire that the current Proposed standard should be ratified with the
minimum amount of further delay, and that the officers' responsibility
to the J11 membership is to pursue all legal means to minimize any
further delay. (If you disagree with this assessment, please let me
know.)

..X3 89-051  "Administrative notices" "06 Jun 89"
..LP
Jim Brodie, P J Plauger, and I are still trying to determine the
exact state of affairs with our X3 approval.
We have finally decided to send out this mailing without
a full status report;
that will have to wait for another mailing soon.
..LP
Very briefly, everything is still in the X3 office in Washington.
Our understanding is that Mr Hansberry has asked for a full formal
appeal process.
We will send further information as it becomes available.
..LP
Please do not inundate us with telephone calls asking what
news we have next week.
We are attempting to create a quick-notification network,
and will also send another mailing soon.
..LP
Potentially helpful things for the next stages:
..IP o
If you have not already done so,
please try to obtain access to an e-mail facility that can be
reached through Usenet.
..IP o
If you have information about "portal" services which can connect
Usenet to other existing networks, please telephone me
or send email to plum@PLUMHALL.UU.NET .
..IP o
If you have a new or changed net-address to report,
please send email to Ken Harrenstien, klh@SRI-NIC.ARPA .
..IP o
I would very much appreciate the services of a volunteer to
integrate the ordinary-mail mailing list with the Usenet list.
That is, if every voting member of the committee either
had a net-address, or had someone with a net-address willing
to send quick photocopies,
we would be better prepared for our next phases.
If you can help with this please contact me.
..IP o
If, on the other hand,
you have a net-address but already know that it would be unrealistic
for you to make copies of your mail for a few other members,
please let me know via email.
..LP
Our thanks to everyone who has worked so long and hard on this project.
We will keep you posted.

Plauger + Whitesmiths affiliates (Maurice Fathi & company + ADC in
Japan) all went over the draft from this perspective.  Also, I assume
did Dan Lau from Intel and his affiliates Anders Rundgren in Sweeden
and they did the Intel 8051C (I think that's its name) embedded
system compiler.  Motorola and Zilog were also involved at various
times. Carl Sutton from Tecktronix.  Also, Computer Innovations who
offer rommable stuff.

Of course, Plauger's role as Tech Editor of Embedded Systems 
Programming should not be taken lightly.

I don't see what this has to do with anything. This is the first I've 
heard that he was interested in numerical applications. Besides, 
numerical and embedded are not necessarily related. In fact, I suggest 
that most embedded C stuff is NOT numerically related. NCEG is 
initially interested in vector/parallel, complex, IEEE, and the like 
issues. Now Digital Signal Processing embedded systems might well 
involve these issues but that has not been the mainstream embedded 
application of the past. Besides, numerical extensions was not within 
the agreed framework of the original committee's work definition. The 
fact that NCEG exists meand we are prepared to continue on from where 
the Stnadard left off. It by no means should be interpreted as a bad 
mark against X3J11. In fact, I started NCEG and I have no expertise or 
direct interest in numerical programming; I simply wanted such

I don't see how. const and volatile help out as does pinning down 
stuff on sequence points, sig_atomic_t. Also, so does prototypes as 
gives better quality assurance before burning proms. So does 
assignment-compatibility checking. void * probably helps too as does 
spec of minimum library, limits.h and float.h. locale.h may well play 
a role here too in future workstations.



I don't recall his ever supporting his arguments with concrete 
examples of problems in any environment let alone embedded systems 
programming. Sounds like a last ditched effort as far as I can see.

We have received copies of Hansberry's protests.  There are a number of
claims that involve J11:

Claim that our membership does not contain members competent to make
decisions about embedded systems.

Claim that the formation of a Numerical Extensions Group indicates that
numerical users believe that C is still not a suitable language for
numerical work.

Claim that the failure to adopt Hansberry's proposals in Seattle will
make his work as an embedded-systems programmer significantly more
difficult, thus causing him damage and giving him the standing to
initiate a formal appeal.

Please discuss these with the other voting members in your local area
(refer to 89-052).  Please by noon Thursday (tomorrow) phone or e-mail
any information which helps to refute these claims, all three of which
I believe to be incorrect.

I will keep you posted on developments.

89-055 PRELIMINARY DRAFT #1
04 Jul 1989
Current status of X3J11 standard

Thomas Plum  609-927-3770 Plum Hall Inc
1 Spruce Av, Cardiff NJ 08232 USA
uunet!plumhall!plum  OR  plum@PLUMHALL.UU.NET

On 29 June, X3 received an 8(?)-page addendum from Russell Hansberry,
adding to the 26-page appeal received previously.  Copies of both
documents are being expressed to X3J11 officers, to be received
Wednesday 05 July.

There will be an all-day meeting at the X3 Secretariat Friday 07 July,
with officers from J11, X3, SPARC (Standards Planning and Requirements
Committee), and SMC (Secretariat Management Committee).  J11 will be
represented by Plauger (Secretary) and Plum (Vice-Chair).  Brodie
(Chair) concurs with this representation.

We have been asked to provide a chronology of J11's interactions with
Hansberry.  I believe he makes a claim that he did not receive an
adequate hearing.  Therefore, the e-mail distribution of this paper
is accompanied by my rough draft of the chronology (89-056.1).  The main
focus is "Who talked with Hansberry, and for how long?".

Three requests:

(1) Please check this chronology for accuracy and completeness; it needs
more details.  By noon Thursday (06 July), please e-mail or phone with
any changes for the chronology.

(2) (Referring to 89-052, the list of current voting members) If you
know of someone in your local region, who does not receive e-mail, and
was involved in this chronology, please telephone them to see if they
can add any details.

(3) If your company has X3 representation, please discuss this
upcoming Friday meeting with your X3 representative.  If they feel that
it is appropriate, suggest that they telephone any of the X3, SPARC, or
SMC Chair or Vice-Chair people, so that they have some sense of how
their constituents feel about this Hansberry delay.

The officers of J11 believe that an overwhelming consensus of J11
desire that the current Proposed standard should be ratified with the
minimum amount of further delay, and that the officers' responsibility
to the J11 membership is to pursue all legal means to minimize any
further delay. (If you disagree with this assessment, please let me
know.)

       Thanks for your help, some progress.
03/__  30-45m  Hansberry to Tom MacDonald:
       Technical. "Most of your points already have been discussed."

Was on vacation for awhile, catching up now.

- Dave Yost was never on the X3J11 e-mail list, so that's OK.
- John Peyton was added as peyton@APOLLO.COM.

A few people are still failing to get their mail, e.g. keie@cs.vu.nl appears
to be unreachable... at least from here.  After I have time to gather up
some examples, I'll let you know who they are, in case you have other

Programmers who need to recurse can do so without using main() as the
name of the recursive function.  main() has some special attributes
that could (and apparently do, on VMS at least) require special
treatment for the main() function.  We have practically guaranteed
that some implementations will have to handle main() specially, due
to permitting it to be validly defined both with and without
parameters.

I think you're right about old-style function definitions needing to
create an equivalent prototype.

Dear X3J11 member,

In my first official act as your (acting) International Rep I need
your input on something, and it's not even C-related.

I need to cast a vote on a ballot re ALGOL 60. Since the US has no 
standards group dealing with this, ANSI is asking all other language 
groups to provide input. You have three choices:

Either ALGOL 60 ISO 1538:1984 should be:

A) confirmed
B) Revised
C) Withdrawn

If you feel at all qualified in this matter PLEASE contact me 
immediately. Due to the limited time I have left to respond and my 
travel schedule, I can only accept email responses (to 
uunet!aussie!rex) that arrive here by mid-Sunday July 16th.  After
that (or instead of email) phone me on (703) 860-0091.  I work out of
home so weekends is fine.  There's an answering machine too.

Thanks in advance.

----
BTW, does anyone out there believe an ANSI-conformant implementation 
requires that main be able to be called reliably, recursively? This is 
a serious issue.

I don't think main() can be used recursively, because the nested call
would violate the specification with regard to how the parameters are
set up upon entry to main(), i.e. would conflict with what we say for
normal functions.

Programmers who need to recurse can do so without using main() as the
name of the recursive function.  main() has some special attributes
that could (and apparently do, on VMS at least) require special
treatment for the main() function.  We have practically guaranteed
that some implementations will have to handle main() specially, due
to permitting it to be validly defined both with and without
parameters.

I think you're right about old-style function definitions needing to
create an equivalent prototype.

I disagree.  I see nothing in the description of main() that disallows
a strictly conforming program from calling its own main().  There are
requirements on the startup call's arguments to main(), and requirements
about the return from this initial call, but these do not apply to any
subsequent calls.

I would say that a conforming implementation must allow main() to be
called by a program...subject to the normal function call rules, limits
on stack space, and so on.  Putting it another way, the following should
be a strictly conforming program that always prints "Hello world" and
terminates successfully:

	#include <stdio.h>

	int
	main(int argc, char **argv)
	{
		if (argc > 0)
			return 32767 - main(0, (char **)0);
		(void)printf("Hello world\n");
		return 32767;
	}

I agree with Dave Prosser, there isn't anything I can see that prohibits
recursion on main() -- something that actually can be useful in at least
one real program I know of.  Why would this be a problem?

By the way, as long as I'm writing, here's a different question that
I'm wondering about.  What happens when you have an old-style function
definition followed later by a new-style (prototype) reference?  The
discussion of compatibility in 3.5.4.3 (p.69, l.12-25) doesn't
distinguish between the ordering.  This appears to imply that every
old-style function definition, even though it doesn't declare a
prototype, must still create and carry around a prototype which is
totally invisible EXCEPT for this single solitary special case.  Ugh!

Consider an (existing) implementation in which main actually calls
the startup code, not vice versa.  Subsequent calls to main then also 
call the startup code causing the program to crash and burn.

I agree with Ken and Doug--each old-style function definition that has
so far appeared in a compilation unit must retain some information about
its parameters.  Not enough so as to cause any modification in argument
passing, but enough to give a diagnostic should a mismatching prototype
occur (at file scope) for one of these functions.  Of course, a "quality"
implementation will make use of this information to give diagnostics
about any misshaped calls to the function, but that's not required.

treatment for the main() function.  We have practically guaranteed
that some implementations will have to handle main() specially, due
to permitting it to be validly defined both with and without
parameters.

I think you're right about old-style function definitions needing to
create an equivalent prototype.

Can this mailing list be used to keep us up-to-date on the Hansberry
situation?  I, for one, would be interested in what has been happening.
I would also like to keep my X3 representative informed as far as he
may be involved, although I realize that there may be some discussion
we may want to keep within X3J11.

Which of Hansberry's issues is he still pursuing?  I have a copy of
89-017 which has 20 points.

Thanks.

.X3 89-058 "Current status, and cancellation of meeting" \
    "01 Aug 89"     "Jim Brodie"

This is a formal notice that the meeting scheduled for Salt Lake
City on September 21st and 22nd, 1989 has been CANCELLED.

Let me give you a little background on our current status to help
explain why the meeting has been cancelled.

We submitted the draft standard and our responses to Mr.
Hansberry's comments to the X3 Secretariat following the April
X3J11 meeting.  This was done on the timetable discussed at that
meeting.

Mr. Hansberry, however, did not accept our responses and has
written a formal appeal to X3, challenging the work of X3J11.
The appeal is fairly lengthy, raising about 40 different
technical and procedural issues.  It also threatens legal action
if he is not satisfied with the results.

According to the X3 rules only procedural issues can be addressed
in an appeal.  The technical issues will be considered closed if
no negative X3 votes arise during the reconsideration ballot
which is currently being conducted.  (Mr Hansberry's letter and
our responses were, after a delay because of the appeal,
distributed to the X3 members and they have been given an
opportunity to change their vote based solely on the issues
raised in his paper).  This reconsideration ballot will close
August 2, 1989.

The procedural issues are not so easily addressed.  Each appeal
issue must be responded to by X3.  Tom Plum and Bill Plauger met
with the X3 leadership, in Washington D.C., to help organize,
supply information for, and expedite the X3 response to the
appeal.  The formal procedures for the appeal process,
unfortunately, take a considerable amount of time.

A response to Mr Hansberry's appeal has been prepared and sent
out by X3 (with a lot of help from Tom Plum).  The X3 position is
that appeal is unwarranted and that no additional remedial action
is required.

If Mr. Hansberry accepts the X3 response (or does not respond by
August 15, 1989 ) and there are no ballot changes during the
reconsideration ballot, the proposed draft C standard will be
forwarded up to ANSI for consideration during August.

If Mr. Hansberry does not accept the X3 response to his appeal,
then a formal appeal board must be formed.  The process for
forming and convening this board will probably take a least two
months.  The findings of this board will govern what further
steps must be taken.

If the board finds in favor of X3J11 (as we currently believe
that they should), the standard will be forwarded on to ANSI at
the conclusion of their work.

The ANSI committee, BSR, that reviews draft proposed standards
meets in the middle of October and the middle of December.  If by
some outside chance we get the draft proposed C standard to them
in time to be considered during the October meeting, we would, if
there are no further problems, have a standard by November, 1989.
If we miss October and make the December meeting, it will
probably be January, 1990 before we formally have an approved
standard.

If still not satisfied, Mr Hansberry has the option of appealing
yet again at the ANSI level.  However, in most cases, this appeal
is processed after the draft proposed standard receives the
American National Standard status.

The bottom line on all of this is that we don't have a C standard
yet.  We, therefore, are not in a position to begin the process
of doing interpretations.  This makes a September meeting of very
limited value.  Since it seems our time and travel budgets are
always strained, the officers believed that it was better to
simply cancel this meeting and aim for the March, 1990 meeting in
New York.

If you have any questions, please feel free to give me a call.  I
have recently accepted a position with Honeywell Inc in Phoenix.
My new phone number is (602) 863-5462.

During the week of November 13 - 17, 1989 the "Supercomputer 89" conference
will be held in Reno, Nevada.  I am organizing a workshop on Friday the
17th.  The topic is "Scientific and Numerical Programming in C."  The
focus of the workshop is to discuss issues involved with using C for
numerical and scientific applications.  This includes programming
techniques used to achieve high performance on supercomputers and any
issues involved with using C on supercomputers.  This also includes C
derivatives such as C++, C*, and Objective C.

Please let me know if you have any interest in making a presentation
or if you know of someone else that I could contact.  The popularity
of C on supercomputers is increasing every year and this is an excellent
opportunity to learn about and discuss issues that affect all of us.

Thank you for your interest.

During the week of November 13 - 17, 1989 the "Supercomputer 89" conference
will be held in Reno, Nevada.  I am organizing a workshop on Friday the
17th.  The topic is "Scientific and Numerical Programming in C."  The
focus of the workshop is to discuss issues involved with using C for
numerical and scientific applications.  This includes programming
techniques used to achieve high performance on supercomputers and any
issues involved with using C on supercomputers.  This also includes C
derivatives such as C++, C*, and Objective C.

Please let me know if you have any interest in making a presentation
or if you know of someone else that I could contact.  The popularity
of C on supercomputers is increasing every year and this is an excellent
opportunity to learn about and discuss issues that affect all of us.

Thank you for your interest.

It is my very sad task to tell you that Joan Hall left her physical
form this past August 17.  She had struggled against a cancer problem
for over two years, with apparent success until last month, when a
rapidly growing liver involvement overcame her.

I have not spent much time in the office since then.  Jim Brodie and
P. J. Plauger have been handling any necessary X3J11 business in
the meantime.

Joan always cared passionately that we would be of service to people
and represent the highest possible integrity.  We will attempt to see
that all our commitments to our customers and associates will be met
in a way that would make her proud.  I thank you collectively for
the regard you had for her and for our work.

I am beginning to outline some articles that discuss
the new official (as of the future article-release date)
ANSI Standard for C.

What kind of questions are people asking you about ANSI C?
What concerns do your users have?

Here are a few of my current notes for the UNIX-related article:
What preparations does a project need to make to transition from
old UNIX (V.3 or 4.3 or other POSIX) C to full ANSI C?
What tools are available to help with any transition difficulties?
How much more restrictive is strict-ANSI (for any environment at all)
portability vs portability to a System V or POSIX or X/OPEN
environment?

If you have any information on these questions, or other questions
to propose, please beam them to me.  Thanks for your comments.

By the way, the X3J11 situation is that a meeting has been scheduled
for the panel to hear the procedural appeal; it is set for 20 October.
We certainly expect that X3J11 and X3 will be upheld by the panel,
but there is not much more I can tell you.  If all goes well, we will
reach the 15 December meeting of ANSI Board of Standards Review.

I am beginning to outline some articles that discuss
the new official (as of the future article-release date)
ANSI Standard for C.

What kind of questions are people asking you about ANSI C?
What concerns do your users have?

Here are a few of my current notes for the UNIX-related article:
What preparations does a project need to make to transition from
old UNIX (V.3 or 4.3 or other POSIX) C to full ANSI C?
What tools are available to help with any transition difficulties?
How much more restrictive is strict-ANSI (for any environment at all)
portability vs portability to a System V or POSIX or X/OPEN
environment?

If you have any information on these questions, or other questions
to propose, please beam them to me.  Thanks for your comments.

By the way, the X3J11 situation is that a meeting has been scheduled
for the panel to hear the procedural appeal; it is set for 20 October.
We certainly expect that X3J11 and X3 will be upheld by the panel,
but there is not much more I can tell you.  If all goes well, we will
reach the 15 December meeting of ANSI Board of Standards Review.

I have been informed verbally by Jean-Paul Emard, Director of the
X3 Standards Secretariat, that the X3J11 draft was unanimously(!)
approved by the ANSI Board of Standards Review on 14 December 1989.
There appears to be high probability that an appeal will be filed with
them.  If so, I understand that the appeal will be resolved at their
February meeting.  We still expect that approval will be completed by
the time of our March meeting.

Please change:

By telephone conversation with Louise Germani,
at ANSI Board of Standards Review, I have confirmed the news given to me
yesterday by Jean Paul Emard at X3:
The time allowed for receipt of appeals to ANSI has expired.
No appeals have been received.
The approval by ANSI BSR is official.
The C Standard will be known as ANS X3.159-1989, because the approval
meeting was 14 December 1989.

I convey this news to you with great, and mixed, emotions.
Let me just express, on behalf of everyone, to everyone,
thanks for everything that was done to bring about this long-delayed result.

PS: My apologies if you had trouble reaching plumhall.uu.net last week;
we had a series of hardware problems.  Access should now be reliable.

By telephone conversation with Louise Germani,
at ANSI Board of Standards Review, I have confirmed the news given to me
yesterday by Jean Paul Emard at X3:
The time allowed for receipt of appeals to ANSI has expired.
No appeals have been received.
The approval by ANSI BSR is official.
The C Standard will be known as ANS X3.159-1989, because the approval
meeting was 14 December 1989.

I convey this news to you with great, and mixed, emotions.
Let me just express, on behalf of everyone, to everyone,
thanks for everything that was done to bring about this long-delayed result.

PS: My apologies if you had trouble reaching plumhall.uu.net last week;
we had a series of hardware problems.  Access should now be reliable.

The following text will apear in Volume 1, number 4, March 1990, of 
The Journal of C Language Translation. Although it was written by Rex 
Jaeschke, it will apear as part of Jim Brodie's Standards Column.

It is reproduced here for your convenience as a service by the

The American National Standard for C has finally been approved.
The period for appeals before enactment of the standard has now
passed and actual publication of the standard should occur shortly. 
(ANSI anticipates copies being available by late March.) The
Standard's official designation is ANSI X3.159-1989.  To obtain a
copy, contact:

	American National Standards Institute
	Sales Department
	1430 Broadway
	New York, NY 10018
	(212) 642-4900
	fax (212) 302-1286

At press time, the price of the standard had not yet been determined.

{Interpretations Phase}

If you would like to formally submit a request for interpretation, do
so to:

	X3 Secretariat
	CBEMA

	Suite 500
	Washington, DC 20001-2178

{The U.S. Government FIPS}

There is not yet a Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS)
for C.  Referencing a FIPS significantly simplifies the process of
using a language in a U.S. defense project.  Now that the ANSI standard
for C has been approved the C FIPS should follow soon.  Sometime in
February 1990 the FIPS proposal will be issued for a 90 day public
comment period.  Assuming there are no objections, the FIPS is
presented to the U.S.  Secretary of Commerce for signing.  It is
expected this whole process will be completed during the Fall of
1990.  This is then followed by a six month acceptance period after
which the FIPS becomes final.  Note, however, that since the ANSI
Standard exists right now, a U.S. Government agency can require
conformance to that standard in RFPs right now! They do not need to
wait until a FIPS is produced.

{The Formal Validation Process}

On the U.S. front, activity in that direction has also begun in
earnest.  According to the National Institute of Standards and
Technology (NIST) they issued a Request For Proposal (RFP) in late
January asking for submissions of C language validation test suites. 
To get a copy of the solicitation for C language validation suite RFP
(Solicitation Number 52SBNB0C6O42) contact:

	National Institute of Standards and Technology
	Contracts Department
	Gaithersburg, MD 20899

Note that the process of selecting or developing a validation suite is 
not related to the FIPS. That is, the suite may be finalized 
before or after a FIPS is produced.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

Since late in 1989 we've heard much of the upheaval in the Eastern
European Bloc.  Until you can relate to it personally, it's just
another news item.  What's this to do with you? Well recently I
recieved a letter from a Senior Software Engineer in Romania.  The
relevant extract follows:

   Prior to, and during, the recent revolution in Romania we at the
   Research Institute for Computers suffered much.  Much hardware was
   damaged or destroyed and we also lost considerable software and many
   books.

   I would be very grateful if you could help me, by appealing to your
   readers, rebuild our collection of books and documentation on C,
   C++, and expert systems.  Also software and even hardware if
   possible.

I have put together a shipment of books and manuals that I intend to
send.  I encourage you to do the same.  If you have any doubts about
export restrictions on certain items (hardware, for example) consult
your national Trade Commission or relevant government agency.  Since
I know they are using Borland's Turbo C it appears they at least have
IBM-PC compatibles.

The address to send computer care packages is:

	Doru Turturea
	Research Institute for Computers
	Strada Clucererului No 1, Sector 1
	Bloc 40, Scarad
	Bucuresti 71308
	ROMANIA

Apart from doing a good deed for our colleagues abroad I'm sure some
in your marketing department would love the press coverage a generous
donation could bring.  Think about it.  Wouldn't your company like to
get a foot into the door of the newly opened Eastern Europe
marketplace?

The time allowed for receipt of appeals to ANSI has expired.
No appeals have been received.
The approval by ANSI BSR is official.
The C Standard will be known as ANS X3.159-1989, because the approval
meeting was 14 December 1989.

I convey this news to you with great, and mixed, emotions.
Let me just express, on behalf of everyone, to everyone,
thanks for everything that was done to bring about this long-delayed result.

PS: My apologies if you had trouble reaching plumhall.uu.net last week;
we had a series of hardware problems.  Access should now be reliable.
