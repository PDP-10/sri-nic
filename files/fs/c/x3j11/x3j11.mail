I think I've received just about all the responses I'm going to get, so
here's the setup:

	To send a message to everyone, mail to: X3J11@SRI-NIC.ARPA.
	To request changes etc, use the usual:  X3J11-REQUEST@SRI-NIC.ARPA.

I'm enclosing the current distribution list below, so you can see
who's on and who's not.  You will probably find the format a bit odd,
but understandable (it's meant for direct reading by our TOPS-20
mailer).  I've used domain name addresses whenever possible, which is why
many of them go through UUNET.  If you know of a better address, or
have more people to add, please send your updates to X3J11-REQUEST.

I'm also keeping a log file of the messages, but it's not publicly
readable since I wasn't sure whether people wanted their discussions
open or not; SRI-NIC is a highly visible site.  I'm also initially
assuming that this list is restricted to X3J11 members only, until
said members decide otherwise.

OK, have at it!

Subject: ANSI C draft reprinted just before being sent to X3

At essentially the last minute, a problem was found regarding
CLK_TCK when the ANSI C draft and POSIX are combined and the
pair are then matched against X/OPEN and SVID.  Keeping the
story short, ANSI + (X/OPEN, SVID) => CLK_TCK == 1000000, but
(POSIX, /usr/group) + (X/OPEN, SVID) => CLK_TCK ~= 50 or 60 or 100.
In order to work around this minor problem (which appears that
it would have required a March meeting if it had not been fixed
now), the name CLK_TCK was changed to CLOCKS_PER_SEC in the ANSI C
draft.  A new draft (dated December 7) was printed with a few
editorial changes, all approved unanimously by the draft review
subcommittee.

The new draft has two document numbers: 88-158 (without diffmarks)
and 88-159 (with diffmarks).  The following is the list of changes
with October 31, 1988 references and approximate May 13, 1988
references:

	Summary of changes since October 31st draft
Oct. 31 refs	May 13 refs
Page Line(s)	Page Line(s)
   3  6-7	   3  5-6	Definition of character changed to two
				sentences.  "Character -- a bit representation
				that fits in a byte.  The representation of
				each member of the basic character set in both
				the source and execution environments shall
				fit in a byte."

  25   19	  24  ~17	Added a footnote (18) noting that array and
				functions behave differently when qualified.
				"See \(sc3.5.3 regarding qualified array and
				function types."

  35   21,28,30	  34   20,27,29	"When an integer" -> "When a value with
 				integral type"  (Note that line 20 was "When
				an unsigned integer...".)

  50   24	  48    2	"other is a" -> "other is a pointer to a"

 131   11	 127  9-10	"mode instead may" -> "mode may instead"
				(Full version of last sentence in paragraph:
				"Opening (or creating) a text file with
				update mode may instead open (or create) a
				binary stream in some implementations.")

 133   24	 129   18	"A" -> "As noted above, a"
 133   24	 129   18	Delete " instead of a digit string"

                    ****************************


Dear X3J11 Members,

This is the official notice that we will NOT be having our
tentatively scheduled March 6-7, 1989 X3J11 meeting in
Seattle, Washington.

The primary reason for cancelling the March meeting is that
the X3 ballot on our draft will not close until March 3rd.
(There were various delays in the handling of the documents
by the X3 Secretariat.)  If, as we all hope, there are no
negative X3 ballots, we would have lost the primary reason
for the meeting.  However, at that point, it would be too
late to cancel the meeting.

The meeting is being tentatively resceduled for April 10-11,
1989.  Microsoft continues to show great patience with our
dynamic scheduling and has agreed to host the April meeting
in Seattle.   Hotel information will be coming in a later
mailing.

We are not certain that we will have the April meeting.  It
depends on how the X3 ballot goes and what other business we
may need to deal with at that time.  For example, there are
still some problems in the International arena.  We
may also want to plan our approach to the maintenance phase
which we, hopefully, will soon be entering.

I will pass on the results of the balloting as soon as they
become available.  I will pass on definite meeting plans as
soon as possible after that.

The new meeting date is the same as our original meeting
schedule so I hope that it will not cause too many conflicts
with your plans.  I apologize for any inconvenience that
this may cause you.

Thanks for your continued patience and support.

Sincerely,
    Jim Brodie
    X3J11 Chair

Thomas Plum
Vice Chair ANSI X3-J11
Plum Hall
1 Spruce Ave
Cardiff, NJ 08232


Dear Mr Plum:

    A syntactic ambiguity exists in the dpANS C  standard  for  which
there  appears  to  be  no  semantic  disambiguation.   A sequence of
examples  should  explain   the   ambiguity.    This   matter   needs
interpretation by the ANSI X3-J11 committee.

    For these examples, let T be declaration specifiers which contain
at least one type specifier, to satisfy the semantics from  3.5.6:


"If the identifier is redeclared in an inner scope ..., the type
specifiers shall not be omitted in the inner declaration."


    Let U be an identifier which is a typedef name at outer scope and
has  not  (yet)  been redeclared at current scope.  A caret indicates
the position of each abstract declarator.  Consider this declaration:


declaration-specifiers direct-declarator (T (U));
                                           ^

    Here U is  the  type  of  the  single  parameter  to  a  function
returning type T, due to a constraint from  3.5.4.2:


"In  a parameter declaration, a single typedef name in parentheses is
taken to be an abstract declarator that specifies a function  with  a
single  parameter, not as redundant parentheses around the identifier
for a declarator."


    Consider this declaration:


declaration-specifiers direct-declarator (T (U (parameter-type-list)));
                                           ^  ^

    In this example, U could be the type returned by a function which
takes  parameter-type-list.   This  in  turn  would  be  the   single
parameter to a function returning type T.

    Alternatively,  U  could be a redundantly parenthesized name of a
function which takes parameter-type-list and returns type T.

    Given the spirit of the constraint from    3.5.4.2,  the  former
interpretation  seems  to  be  that  intended  by  ANSI.   If so, the
constraint may be changed to something similar to:


"In a parameter declaration, a direct declarator which  redeclares  a
typedef name shall not be redundantly parenthesized."


    Of course, parentheses must not be disallowed entirely.  Consider
this unambiguous redeclaration of typedef name U:


declaration-specifiers direct-declarator (T (* U)(parameter-type-list));


    If you require more information or  discussion  on  this  matter,
please contact me, at (508) 671-4156, or by  mail  at  the  indicated
address,  M/S  826A.   Your  prompt  consideration  of this matter is
greatly appreciated.


                                Sincerely,

Just out of curiousity, I'm wondering how many people are planning to
attend this meeting (April 10-11) and whether there will actually be
anything to vote on.  Unfortunately I have too many conflicts to go
myself and don't have an alternate, but perhaps it doesn't matter as
much as it used to?

The meeting was held in conjunction with WG14 (the ISO C standardization
committee).  There were two concerns raised:
 UK: not happy with the "behavior is undefined if we say nothing" blanket.
     They wanted the draft to wait for their completed list of (possibly)
     unconsidered items for its folding into the draft.  A compromise was
     agreed to that the X3J11 interpretations group would look over the
     resulting list and issue a "technical bulletin" through ANSI
     containing the points with which they agreed.
 Danes: want a more readable supplement to trigraphs.  They even lost their
     WG14 support for such a change in this meeting, and no change was made
     on these lines in the draft.

A surprise for X3J11 was a lost 2nd round public review letter from Russell
Hansberry.  As Russell lives in the Seattle area, he attended the meeting
and spent time with a large subgroup that looked over the 20 points in the
letter.  The subgroup recommended making no changes in the draft.  But,
since Mr. Hansberry chose "his day in court", another X3 level review is
necessary--but only based on our "no"s to this letter.  We hoped to be able
to use an expedited 20-day review, but I have just found out that such did
not occur, and the draft is still in the X3 committee....

The final major item from the meeting was the issue of C++ standardization
and how it relates to X3J11.  X3J11 had received three requests regarding
C++ standardization: H-P asking X3J11 to do the job; ISO and X3 asking X3J11
whether it's time for C++ to be standardized.  H-P's proposal was defeated
12/22, but on whether C++ should start standardization, an informal poll of
the room produced 40 "yes"/12 "don't care"/3 "no", but a committee vote on
the next day produced 12 "yes"/12 "no"/13 "abstain".

Administrative items:
 Bill Plauger cannot continue as international representative.  There were
   no volunteers for the job.
 The next meeting is Sept. 21-22 in Salt Lake City (DECUS)
 A tentative subsequent meeting was set for March 5-6, 1990 in NYC.
 Apple will do mailing.  Deadline ~August 19th to Plum.

 X3J11 MEETING -   April 10-11 1989,  Seattle
 --------------------------------------------
 --------------------------------------------
 
  The purpose of the meeting was 3-fold:
    1.  Discuss and resolve any International issues remaining.
    2.  Formally respond to a letter from Russell Hansberry.
    3.  Make plans for future directions for X3J11 and plans for the
        interpretation phase.

  The Standard has been delayed from going up to ANSI due to a "lost"
  public response from Russell Hansberry.   X3 rules dictated that the
  Committee respond formally to the Hansberry paper since it had been
  sent prior to the cut off date for public response.  The Committee did
  respond to the paper (and to Hansberry who was at the meeting) at this
  meeting.  (More will follow on his complaints.)  As a result of this 
  delay,  the draft has to go back to X3 for a vote prior to going to
  ANSI.  The expectation is that the X3 vote will take about a month to
  a month and a half.  There may be problems with this vote since
  Hansberry will be recommending a NO vote to several X3 board members.

  The International community is also rather unhappy with portions of
  the draft and the Committee addressed some of those concerns but
  voted to not change the draft.  This action prompted at least one  
  other person, a X3J11 member, to say that he will do what he can 
  to influence X3 members to vote NO vote on the Standard.

  Content of the meeting
  ----------------------

  I.  INTERNATIONAL ISSUES:

     British issues:
     -------------
	 The British representative felt that their complaints were 
	 not addressed.  They want all locations where  undefined 
	 behavior exists to be explicitly stated.  As they say it, they  
	 want all holes filled in.

	 X3J11 seems to thinks the British were too vague as to their
	 complaints all along.  The position it has held on undefined
	 issues is that there are so many places where things are not
	 defined, it is best to just have the policy that anything that
	 is not specified, is undefined.
       
	 BSI has pulled away from influencing ANSI and pushed for
	 acceptance of addendum that  fills in holes as to what is 
	 undefined.  X3J11 voted to accept an addendum, when completed,
	 to the Standard that will outline all places the behavior is
	 undefined.  BSI members will probably be doing all the work
	 in this regard.



     Danish issues:
     -------------
	The Danish  have proposed several changes from the beginning and
	it seems with no luck or positive response from the Committee.

	They have proposed the following.

	Additions to the trigraph syntax:
	  They want to allow a digraph representation for a few of them.
	     i.e.   :(  for {
                    :)  for } 
	  The issue here is primarily one of "how beautiful" something 
	  looks on paper (something I'm for!).
	  However it was felt by the Committee (X3J11) that this
	  could cause potential problems in scanning and parsing,
	  and require addition of new tokens to the language.   Also it 
	  was felt that the character set should remain constant. 
	  Readability was seen as a problem in any representation here
	  and promoting one way over the other was not necessarily better.
	  This change was seen as substantive and was voted down.

        Additional array representation: 
	    They would like to add infix operators for array
	    representation:
	    for example:
	      a[b] => a!b    and
	      a[]  => a!

	      The  Committee felt that this could cause  possible
	      ambiguities and voted against it. 
	   
	New header file containing defines for operators:
	   <ISO646.h>  containing
		#define CAND  && 
                #define COR   || 
                #define AND   & 
                #define OR    | 
                #define COMPL ~ 
                #define XOR   ^ 

             The Committee voted this down primarily on the basis that
	     this would just necessarily add new reserved words that
	     are frequently added by users and really doesn't add
	     anything useful. 

       The Danish are VERY unhappy about the outcome of this and will
       recommend the ISO go their own direction.  They had wanted the
       same standard as ANSI but cannot accept as now exists.

     General International Issues
     ----------------------------
       WG14 (the ISO corollary of X3J11) voted to accept the Standard 
       (or to recommend acceptance of the Standard) by ISO.  
       The Danish representative voted against that acceptance.   
       For a while I though the British representative wasn't going  
       to vote positively either until the Committee voted 
       to accept an addendum to the Standard outlining the undefined 
       places. The International community does want to see the same
       standard and ANSI and is willing to bend to some degree to get
       it.   The main problem now is with the Danish.  It remains to be seen
       what ISO does.


   II. HANSBERRY PAPER:

       After considerable discussion, the Committee formally voted 
       against all his proposals.  Hansberry says he is not happy 
       with the outcomes and will do what he can to get a negative 
       vote at the X3 level.
       
       In specific, among other things, these are the issues brought 
       to the entire committee by a subgroup of X3J11 reviewing the 
       entire paper:

       1). Operator precedence.  
	   He wants bitwise operators to have higher precedence than 
	   relational. As it is now, when using bitwise and relational
	   operators in the same expression, parentheses are required
	   around the "bitwise" expression and are sometimes forgotten.

	   The Committee felt this would break too many existing programs
 	   and while it is a good idea, it's too late to do it for C. Even
	   if this paper was received early on in the standardization
	   process, they probably would have voted it down.

 
       2). Interrupts  
	   Hansberry wants a standardized  way to specify interrupts and 
	   save the current environment during them.

	   The Committee felt this was not a C- language issue and was better
	   handled elsewhere (such as the systems level).
    
       3). Register Storage Class.  
	   He wants programmer ordering of register storage class
	   specification to dictate priority.
	 
	   The Committee felt that with new techniques for optimization, 
	   it's best to leave such matters to the optimizer.  Also, 
	   such order is frequently thrown out in the processing of 
	   such declarations. There was a certain amount of support 
	   for this idea but it didn't win out.


   III. NUMERICS SUBCOMMITTEE FORMATION:

        Persons interested in Numerical C Extensions will be holding a
        meeting May 10-11 (Wed. and Thurs.)  in Minneapolis.  This is 
        an initial "get-together" meeting to see how much  interest there 
        actually is in such a group and to work out the important issues 
        and a plan of attack. The group is currently an informal group but 
        if there is enough interest will probably become a subcommittee of 
        X3J11.  X3J11 is interested in having a numerical extensions subgroup 
        if there are interested people wanting to work on it.

        Pyramid should probably send someone with interest and expertise
        in numerical issues.


   IV.  DISCUSSION OF C++ ISSUES:

        Basic content of the discussion centered on the following
        arguments.

           There is a dichotomy between those seeing C++ as a separate
	   language from C and as extension of the C- mentality.

	   The consensus is that there IS a need for an OO-based language
	   though members of the Committee didn't feel qualified in that
	   area.

	   Some felt that there hasn't been enough experience yet 
	   with C++  and its environment and it would be too premature
	   to start a standardization effort.

	   C++ is still changing. Stroustrup is adding more things to 
	   the language, particularly parameterized types and exception 
	   handling and we do not have  enough experience with what works 
	   yet to have a standard.  The language is still in flux and not 
	   yet fully defined by use.

	   There was a feeling among many in the Committee that a 
	   standardization effort should exist for C++ but X3J11  was 
	   not the place to do it.


        The Committee voted to not take it on and to not even recommend 
	that an effort begin (by 'someone') to work on standardization of 
	C++ since members  felt that they didn't have enough experience 
	in C++ to recommend in any way.


  V. INTERPRETATION PHASE FOR X3J11:
  

        The interpretation phase of the ANSI - C standard begins now 
	(assuming it is accepted this time by X3).

        Requests for information or interpretation  of the  Standard will
        be sent to X3J11.  Tom Plum and Jim Brodie will coordinate them 
	and the responses.
    
        Copies of each request will be sent out to several members of the
        Committee (hopefully to those who live in the  same area) to review 
        and write a response to.  Persons in the same area with the same 
        queries can get together to formulate a response to them.  Responses 
        will be returned to Plum or Brodie for collation. 
    
        The Committee as a whole will review the responses at its meetings
        (every 6 months) and accept them amend them as needed.  Every six
        months, following the meeting, X3J11 will publish the responses and
        any corrections to the draft generated as a result of the query.
    
        I will be participating in this phase.


  VI.  FUTURE MEETINGS OF X3J11:
  
    
       September 21-22 in Salt Lake City hosted by DECUS.
       March     5-6, 1990  New York City  area.  hosted in part by AT&T

       As of now, the Committee hopes to meet every six months for a day 
       and a half to work on the interpretations phase.

Date: Mon, 05 Jun 89 15:17:49 -0400

   There has been much discussion of "Miranda Rules" for function
argument behavior in the absence of prototypes.  As I understand it,
a function call can be thought of as causing a prototype
to be built that corresponds to widened actual argument types. What
has been implied in non-ANSI literature is that the "Miranda" prototype is
constructed for the initial reference and retained for the rest of the
file.
  My understanding of ANSI function prototyping is that, for
non-prototyped functions, a prototype is constructed anew for each function call.
  This is actually a request from Larry Rosenthal who doesn not have
access to this mailing list.

This is why Larry (Rosler) and I were so strongly against the whole
"Miranda Rule" approach for the description of a function call.  The
implication is strong (given such a description) that there is some
distinguishable lifetime for the prototype...much like there is for
a call to a function through a previously undefined identifier.

In actuality, there is no construction required nor implied.  The
only reason for adopting this sort of approach is that it guarantees
that if the prototype pair match (one from the definition and one
constructed for the call), then the call is well-behaved.  Instead,
the pANS describes what function definitions match what function calls,
both with or without prototypes; the main rule of thumb being that
regular calls and definitions of both styles should be interchangeable,
if reasonable.

Hope this helps for you and Larry.

Hello, I received your confirmation of my message of few months back.
I duly sent back the confirmation you asked me for.
I never received anything after that first message, although messages
seem to have gone out. At least, that is what Rex Jaeschke tells me.

What happened?

                Status______ of__ X3J11_____ Proposed________ Standard________

The following information comes from telephone conversations with
Marilyn  Kornfeld,  Manager  of Projects and Standards, X3 Secre-
tariat:

     In April, Mr Russell Hansberry filed a 27-page appeal to the
     X3  Secretariat.  The appeal deals with procedural questions
     and contains threats of legal  actions.   The  Secretariat's
     lawyers  have  recommended  that  the Secretariat not send a
     copy to X3J11, or at least not yet.

     Mr Hansberry appealed the X3 procedure that allowed him only
     30  days  to  file  his  appeal.  A decision was made at the
     Secretariat to allow him until 1 July to draft his  detailed
     appeal.

The operative procedure here is Section 11 (Appeals Procedure) in
X3/SD-2 (Organization and Procedures):

     The Secretariat must respond to the appeal within  30  days,
     i.e. by 1 August.

     If, after that, the appellant and the Secretariat are unable
     to  resolve  the  complaint, the Secretariat "shall" [must?]
     schedule an three-person  appeals  panel:  one  selected  by
     appellant,  one  by  Secretariat, one jointly.  There are no
     mandated time limits on the panel selection.

     The panel shall render a decision in 30 days.  Section  11.5
     indicates that further appeals may be made to ANSI.

Plum has communicated the following question to the  Secretariat:
What  criteria does the Secretariat follow in determining whether
to grant an appeals panel to an appellant?

X3J11 members from organizations with X3 representation will pro-
bably want to discuss this situation with their representative.

Brodie summarized X3J11's position in his cover letter 89-028: Mr
Hansberry  received  a  fair  hearing,  and the committee did not
adopt any of his proposals.

04 Jul 1989
Current status of X3J11 standard

Thomas Plum  609-927-3770 Plum Hall Inc
1 Spruce Av, Cardiff NJ 08232 USA
uunet!plumhall!plum  OR  plum@PLUMHALL.UU.NET

On 29 June, X3 received an 8(?)-page addendum from Russell Hansberry,
adding to the 26-page appeal received previously.  Copies of both
documents are being expressed to X3J11 officers, to be received
Wednesday 05 July.

There will be an all-day meeting at the X3 Secretariat Friday 07 July,
with officers from J11, X3, SPARC (Standards Planning and Requirements
Committee), and SMC (Secretariat Management Committee).  J11 will be
represented by Plauger (Secretary) and Plum (Vice-Chair).  Brodie
(Chair) concurs with this representation.

We have been asked to provide a chronology of J11's interactions with
Hansberry.  I believe he makes a claim that he did not receive an
adequate hearing.  Therefore, the e-mail distribution of this paper
is accompanied by my rough draft of the chronology (89-056.1).  The main
focus is "Who talked with Hansberry, and for how long?".

Three requests:

(1) Please check this chronology for accuracy and completeness; it needs
more details.  By noon Thursday (06 July), please e-mail or phone with
any changes for the chronology.

(2) (Referring to 89-052, the list of current voting members) If you
know of someone in your local region, who does not receive e-mail, and
was involved in this chronology, please telephone them to see if they
can add any details.

(3) If your company has X3 representation, please discuss this
upcoming Friday meeting with your X3 representative.  If they feel that
it is appropriate, suggest that they telephone any of the X3, SPARC, or
SMC Chair or Vice-Chair people, so that they have some sense of how
their constituents feel about this Hansberry delay.

The officers of J11 believe that an overwhelming consensus of J11
desire that the current Proposed standard should be ratified with the
minimum amount of further delay, and that the officers' responsibility
to the J11 membership is to pursue all legal means to minimize any
further delay. (If you disagree with this assessment, please let me
know.)

We have received copies of Hansberry's protests.  There are a number of
claims that involve J11:

Claim that our membership does not contain members competent to make
decisions about embedded systems.

Claim that the formation of a Numerical Extensions Group indicates that
numerical users believe that C is still not a suitable language for
numerical work.

Claim that the failure to adopt Hansberry's proposals in Seattle will
make his work as an embedded-systems programmer significantly more
difficult, thus causing him damage and giving him the standing to
initiate a formal appeal.

Please discuss these with the other voting members in your local area
(refer to 89-052).  Please by noon Thursday (tomorrow) phone or e-mail
any information which helps to refute these claims, all three of which
I believe to be incorrect.

I will keep you posted on developments.

Dear X3J11 member,

In my first official act as your (acting) International Rep I need
your input on something, and it's not even C-related.

I need to cast a vote on a ballot re ALGOL 60. Since the US has no 
standards group dealing with this, ANSI is asking all other language 
groups to provide input. You have three choices:

Either ALGOL 60 ISO 1538:1984 should be:

A) confirmed
B) Revised
C) Withdrawn

If you feel at all qualified in this matter PLEASE contact me 
immediately. Due to the limited time I have left to respond and my 
travel schedule, I can only accept email responses (to 
uunet!aussie!rex) that arrive here by mid-Sunday July 16th.  After
that (or instead of email) phone me on (703) 860-0091.  I work out of
home so weekends is fine.  There's an answering machine too.

Thanks in advance.

----
BTW, does anyone out there believe an ANSI-conformant implementation 
requires that main be able to be called reliably, recursively? This is 
a serious issue.

I don't think main() can be used recursively, because the nested call
would violate the specification with regard to how the parameters are
set up upon entry to main(), i.e. would conflict with what we say for
normal functions.

I disagree.  I see nothing in the description of main() that disallows
a strictly conforming program from calling its own main().  There are
requirements on the startup call's arguments to main(), and requirements
about the return from this initial call, but these do not apply to any
subsequent calls.

I would say that a conforming implementation must allow main() to be
called by a program...subject to the normal function call rules, limits
on stack space, and so on.  Putting it another way, the following should
be a strictly conforming program that always prints "Hello world" and
terminates successfully:

	#include <stdio.h>

	int
	main(int argc, char **argv)
	{
		if (argc > 0)
			return 32767 - main(0, (char **)0);
		(void)printf("Hello world\n");
		return 32767;
	}

I agree with Dave Prosser, there isn't anything I can see that prohibits
recursion on main() -- something that actually can be useful in at least
one real program I know of.  Why would this be a problem?

By the way, as long as I'm writing, here's a different question that
I'm wondering about.  What happens when you have an old-style function
definition followed later by a new-style (prototype) reference?  The
discussion of compatibility in 3.5.4.3 (p.69, l.12-25) doesn't
distinguish between the ordering.  This appears to imply that every
old-style function definition, even though it doesn't declare a
prototype, must still create and carry around a prototype which is
totally invisible EXCEPT for this single solitary special case.  Ugh!

Programmers who need to recurse can do so without using main() as the
name of the recursive function.  main() has some special attributes
that could (and apparently do, on VMS at least) require special
treatment for the main() function.  We have practically guaranteed
that some implementations will have to handle main() specially, due
to permitting it to be validly defined both with and without
parameters.

I think you're right about old-style function definitions needing to
create an equivalent prototype.

I agree with Ken and Doug--each old-style function definition that has
so far appeared in a compilation unit must retain some information about
its parameters.  Not enough so as to cause any modification in argument
passing, but enough to give a diagnostic should a mismatching prototype
occur (at file scope) for one of these functions.  Of course, a "quality"
implementation will make use of this information to give diagnostics
about any misshaped calls to the function, but that's not required.

.X3 89-058 "Current status, and cancellation of meeting" \
    "01 Aug 89"     "Jim Brodie"

This is a formal notice that the meeting scheduled for Salt Lake
City on September 21st and 22nd, 1989 has been CANCELLED.

Let me give you a little background on our current status to help
explain why the meeting has been cancelled.

We submitted the draft standard and our responses to Mr.
Hansberry's comments to the X3 Secretariat following the April
X3J11 meeting.  This was done on the timetable discussed at that
meeting.

Mr. Hansberry, however, did not accept our responses and has
written a formal appeal to X3, challenging the work of X3J11.
The appeal is fairly lengthy, raising about 40 different
technical and procedural issues.  It also threatens legal action
if he is not satisfied with the results.

According to the X3 rules only procedural issues can be addressed
in an appeal.  The technical issues will be considered closed if
no negative X3 votes arise during the reconsideration ballot
which is currently being conducted.  (Mr Hansberry's letter and
our responses were, after a delay because of the appeal,
distributed to the X3 members and they have been given an
opportunity to change their vote based solely on the issues
raised in his paper).  This reconsideration ballot will close
August 2, 1989.

The procedural issues are not so easily addressed.  Each appeal
issue must be responded to by X3.  Tom Plum and Bill Plauger met
with the X3 leadership, in Washington D.C., to help organize,
supply information for, and expedite the X3 response to the
appeal.  The formal procedures for the appeal process,
unfortunately, take a considerable amount of time.

A response to Mr Hansberry's appeal has been prepared and sent
out by X3 (with a lot of help from Tom Plum).  The X3 position is
that appeal is unwarranted and that no additional remedial action
is required.

If Mr. Hansberry accepts the X3 response (or does not respond by
August 15, 1989 ) and there are no ballot changes during the
reconsideration ballot, the proposed draft C standard will be
forwarded up to ANSI for consideration during August.

If Mr. Hansberry does not accept the X3 response to his appeal,
then a formal appeal board must be formed.  The process for
forming and convening this board will probably take a least two
months.  The findings of this board will govern what further
steps must be taken.

If the board finds in favor of X3J11 (as we currently believe
that they should), the standard will be forwarded on to ANSI at
the conclusion of their work.

The ANSI committee, BSR, that reviews draft proposed standards
meets in the middle of October and the middle of December.  If by
some outside chance we get the draft proposed C standard to them
in time to be considered during the October meeting, we would, if
there are no further problems, have a standard by November, 1989.
If we miss October and make the December meeting, it will
probably be January, 1990 before we formally have an approved
standard.

If still not satisfied, Mr Hansberry has the option of appealing
yet again at the ANSI level.  However, in most cases, this appeal
is processed after the draft proposed standard receives the
American National Standard status.

The bottom line on all of this is that we don't have a C standard
yet.  We, therefore, are not in a position to begin the process
of doing interpretations.  This makes a September meeting of very
limited value.  Since it seems our time and travel budgets are
always strained, the officers believed that it was better to
simply cancel this meeting and aim for the March, 1990 meeting in
New York.

If you have any questions, please feel free to give me a call.  I
have recently accepted a position with Honeywell Inc in Phoenix.
My new phone number is (602) 863-5462.

During the week of November 13 - 17, 1989 the "Supercomputer 89" conference
will be held in Reno, Nevada.  I am organizing a workshop on Friday the
17th.  The topic is "Scientific and Numerical Programming in C."  The
focus of the workshop is to discuss issues involved with using C for
numerical and scientific applications.  This includes programming
techniques used to achieve high performance on supercomputers and any
issues involved with using C on supercomputers.  This also includes C
derivatives such as C++, C*, and Objective C.

Please let me know if you have any interest in making a presentation
or if you know of someone else that I could contact.  The popularity
of C on supercomputers is increasing every year and this is an excellent
opportunity to learn about and discuss issues that affect all of us.

Thank you for your interest.

It is my very sad task to tell you that Joan Hall left her physical
form this past August 17.  She had struggled against a cancer problem
for over two years, with apparent success until last month, when a
rapidly growing liver involvement overcame her.

I have not spent much time in the office since then.  Jim Brodie and
P. J. Plauger have been handling any necessary X3J11 business in
the meantime.

Joan always cared passionately that we would be of service to people
and represent the highest possible integrity.  We will attempt to see
that all our commitments to our customers and associates will be met
in a way that would make her proud.  I thank you collectively for
the regard you had for her and for our work.

I am beginning to outline some articles that discuss
the new official (as of the future article-release date)
ANSI Standard for C.

What kind of questions are people asking you about ANSI C?
What concerns do your users have?

Here are a few of my current notes for the UNIX-related article:
What preparations does a project need to make to transition from
old UNIX (V.3 or 4.3 or other POSIX) C to full ANSI C?
What tools are available to help with any transition difficulties?
How much more restrictive is strict-ANSI (for any environment at all)
portability vs portability to a System V or POSIX or X/OPEN
environment?

If you have any information on these questions, or other questions
to propose, please beam them to me.  Thanks for your comments.

By the way, the X3J11 situation is that a meeting has been scheduled
for the panel to hear the procedural appeal; it is set for 20 October.
We certainly expect that X3J11 and X3 will be upheld by the panel,
but there is not much more I can tell you.  If all goes well, we will
reach the 15 December meeting of ANSI Board of Standards Review.

I have been informed verbally by Jean-Paul Emard, Director of the
X3 Standards Secretariat, that the X3J11 draft was unanimously(!)
approved by the ANSI Board of Standards Review on 14 December 1989.
There appears to be high probability that an appeal will be filed with
them.  If so, I understand that the appeal will be resolved at their
February meeting.  We still expect that approval will be completed by
the time of our March meeting.

By telephone conversation with Louise Germani,

yesterday by Jean Paul Emard at X3:
The time allowed for receipt of appeals to ANSI has expired.
No appeals have been received.
The approval by ANSI BSR is official.
The C Standard will be known as ANS X3.159-1989, because the approval
meeting was 14 December 1989.

I convey this news to you with great, and mixed, emotions.
Let me just express, on behalf of everyone, to everyone,
thanks for everything that was done to bring about this long-delayed result.

PS: My apologies if you had trouble reaching plumhall.uu.net last week;
we had a series of hardware problems.  Access should now be reliable.

The American National Standard for C has finally been approved.
The period for appeals before enactment of the standard has now
passed and actual publication of the standard should occur shortly. 
(ANSI anticipates copies being available by late March.) The
Standard's official designation is ANSI X3.159-1989.  To obtain a
copy, contact:

	American National Standards Institute
	Sales Department
	1430 Broadway
	New York, NY 10018
	(212) 642-4900
	fax (212) 302-1286

At press time, the price of the standard had not yet been determined.

{Interpretations Phase}

If you would like to formally submit a request for interpretation, do
so to:

{The U.S. Government FIPS}

There is not yet a Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS)
for C.  Referencing a FIPS significantly simplifies the process of
using a language in a U.S. defense project.  Now that the ANSI standard
for C has been approved the C FIPS should follow soon.  Sometime in
February 1990 the FIPS proposal will be issued for a 90 day public
comment period.  Assuming there are no objections, the FIPS is
presented to the U.S.  Secretary of Commerce for signing.  It is
expected this whole process will be completed during the Fall of
1990.  This is then followed by a six month acceptance period after
which the FIPS becomes final.  Note, however, that since the ANSI
Standard exists right now, a U.S. Government agency can require
conformance to that standard in RFPs right now! They do not need to
wait until a FIPS is produced.

{The Formal Validation Process}

On the U.S. front, activity in that direction has also begun in
earnest.  According to the National Institute of Standards and
Technology (NIST) they issued a Request For Proposal (RFP) in late
January asking for submissions of C language validation test suites. 
To get a copy of the solicitation for C language validation suite RFP
(Solicitation Number 52SBNB0C6O42) contact:

	National Institute of Standards and Technology
	Contracts Department
	Gaithersburg, MD 20899

Note that the process of selecting or developing a validation suite is 
not related to the FIPS. That is, the suite may be finalized 
before or after a FIPS is produced.

Since late in 1989 we've heard much of the upheaval in the Eastern
European Bloc.  Until you can relate to it personally, it's just
another news item.  What's this to do with you? Well recently I
recieved a letter from a Senior Software Engineer in Romania.  The
relevant extract follows:

   Prior to, and during, the recent revolution in Romania we at the
   Research Institute for Computers suffered much.  Much hardware was
   damaged or destroyed and we also lost considerable software and many
   books.

   I would be very grateful if you could help me, by appealing to your
   readers, rebuild our collection of books and documentation on C,
   C++, and expert systems.  Also software and even hardware if
   possible.

I have put together a shipment of books and manuals that I intend to
send.  I encourage you to do the same.  If you have any doubts about
export restrictions on certain items (hardware, for example) consult
your national Trade Commission or relevant government agency.  Since
I know they are using Borland's Turbo C it appears they at least have
IBM-PC compatibles.

The address to send computer care packages is:

	Doru Turturea
	Research Institute for Computers
	Strada Clucererului No 1, Sector 1
	Bloc 40, Scarad
	Bucuresti 71308
	ROMANIA

Apart from doing a good deed for our colleagues abroad I'm sure some
in your marketing department would love the press coverage a generous
donation could bring.  Think about it.  Wouldn't your company like to
get a foot into the door of the newly opened Eastern Europe
marketplace?

Subject: Interesting observation/informal interpretation request

I was recently made aware of a "hole" in the Standard: the Standard
specifies the result type for every expression operator except
function call.  (Check it out.)  There is a guarantee that the value
of the return expression for the called function (after conversion
to the function's return type if appropriate) is the value of the
function call expression, but this is insufficient to determine the
type completely.

For example, all floating return types could be mapped to "long
double", all signed integer types to "long" and unsigned to
"unsigned long".  Therefore, one might take expressions such as

	sizeof(f())

to have undefined behavior since this is one of the "nothing's in the
Standard" instances.  (A better interpretation, in my view, is that
the value for such an expression is unspecified, but has a definite
lower and upper bound for any particular arithmetic return type.  It
seems reasonable to assume that structure and union return types must
match exactly.)

As it turns out, the interpretations committee cannot simply say that
the resulting type is the return type of the function called.  Most,
if not all, historic C implementations applied the argument promotion
rules to function return types as well as to function argument
expressions.  Thus no narrower than "int" types were returned, and
often the only floating type returned was "double".

It seems appropriate to me to interpret the Standard as giving license
to implementations to choose to widen or not as they so desire.  The
only possible way of seeing this widening would be through the sizeof
operator, and that visibility would likewise be an implementation
choice.

Any other opinions?

Subject: Re: Interesting observation/informal interpretation request

Sam Kendall (kendall@Saber.COM) makes the point that it's not just
sizeof that can be affected by the lack of strict type rules for
function calls.  I would certainly argue that the intent of the
Standard was to allow code such as in his mail:

>   There's one other way that this widening can be made visible: through
>calls to functions that lack prototypes.  For example:
>
>	extern char ret_char(void);
>	extern float ret_float(void);

>	}
>
>	void no_prototype(i, d)
>	int i;
>	double d;
>	{
>		...
>	}
>	
>If `ret_char' returned a `long', or `ret_float' returned a `long
>double', then the call to `no_prototype' wouldn't work.

Fortunately, the old implementation behavior in which the same widening
rules for argument expressions were applied to return types causes no
problems here.

>   We need a constrant that an integral return type cannot be promoted
>to `long' or `long unsigned', and a floating return type cannot be
>promoted to `long double'.

Of course, we can't add new constraints to the Standard now.  However,
the point you make does implicitly contrain implementations to widen
(if at all) to no wider than the default argument promotions.  Since
this matches the behavior of many older implementations, this makes
the interpretation of the Standard quite reasonable!

Subject: X3J11/90-048

Regarding Simonsen and Stroustrup's paper,         06 July 1990
"A European Representation for ISO C"              X3J11/90-048
SC22/WG14/N117                                     X3J16/90-____
                                                   WG14/N____

                                      Thomas Plum, Plum Hall Inc


At the June 19-20 WG14 meeting, Keld Simonsen asked me if I would
communicate my comments on the latest Simonsen/Stroustrup proposal
on character sets.  This latest version is WG14/N117; I will refer
to the proposal in its various forms as the "S&S" proposal.

My first comment is that I never received any feedback regarding
my paper X3J11/88-108, a personal (non-official) comment on their
earlier paper that was distributed as X3J11/88-134.  Rather than
re-hash those comments, I will attempt to outline the issues
one-by-one.

1.  Agreed by all parties:
"ANSI/ISO C needs to have a representation system within ISO 646."

X3J11 and WG14 have agreed on this point for many years.  X3J11
resisted all attempts by various members and public commenters to
eliminate or weaken the support for our adopted solution, the
so-called trigraphs.

I am not sure that SC22 has been clearly informed that ANSI C does
in fact already provide full support for programs in ISO 646.  Keld 
distributed an excerpt from an ISO document, SC22/N615 -- now also
WG14/N123 -- containing the following guideline:

| 5.1.3.1 Guideline: Character sets used for program text
| 
| As far as possible, the language should be defined in terms only of
| the characters included within ISO 646, avoiding the use of any that
| are in national use positions.

X3J11 standardized an existing language which already did use a number
of these characters. We avoided adding any other national use positions.

| If any symbols are used which are not included within ISO 646 or are
| in national use positions, an alternative representation for all such
| symbols should be specified.

X3J11 has done so.  The trigraphs are an alternative representation.

| A conforming processor should be required to be capable of accepting
| a program represented using only this minimal character set.

X3J11 has done so.

| Great care should be taken in specifying how "non-printing"
| characters are to be handled, i.e. those characters that correspond
| to integer values 0 to 32 inclusive and 127, i.e. null (0/0) to
| space (2/0) and delete (7/13).

X3J11 has done so.  The handling of whitespace is consistent across
language and library.  This is also irrelevant to the S&S proposals.

Those of us who worked in X3J11 over several years to develop that
Standard would appreciate it if in future discussions it were first
recognized that our current system of trigraphs does in fact conform
to these guidelines.  Then we can get on with the real issues.

2.  A generally-agreed point:
"The trigraph representation is not very suitable for human eyes."

This is a quote from WG14/N117.  Most people agree; this disagreements
are only in the area of what should be done about this.

3.  Generally-agreed:
"There is no alternative to using trigraphs in strings."

The S&S proposals have never suggested using anything but trigraphs
in strings (and character constants too).  It is, of course, possible
to make a given program more readable by defining macros:

    #define LEFT_BRACE '??<'

and then using the symbolic names, but this goes beyond what S&S
proposed.

4.  Not agreed:
"Introducing more readable names requires new keywords."

This has been a major point of disagreement between X3J11 and the
S&S proposals.  It has been suggested several times that simple
macro names provide all that is required for greater readability.

It would be a pure extension to define a new header -- call
it  <iso646.h>  say -- in which a specified set of new names are
provided.  The S&S proposal even goes so far as to suggest that
"the new keywords could be conditionally in effect for new programs".
If they are conditional, then why not confine them to a header-file
definition?

The only point in the S&S paper that favors new keywords over a
header-file is that (by re-programming every parser) the new keywords
can be combined with  =  to make assignment operators.  But on the
other hand, the header-file can provide  or_equals ,  and_equals ,  and
xor_equals .

5.  Generally agreed:
"Left to local choice, readability conventions will diverge."

If different groups of programmers begin using macros to make the
open-brace and close-brace trigraphs more readable, then in a few
years we will have several incompatible sets of conventions.

What is not generally agreed is that incompatible sets of conventions
are in themselves a major problem worth changing the language for.

However, if a new standard header  <iso646.h>  were adopted, such a
header could provide a consistent set of conventions, which would
also prevent the divergence of conventions.

6.  Not agreed (from my alternative 88-108):
"The names  begin  and  end  have been proposed, and are adequate."

My paper 88-108 suggested  begin  and  end  as the most popular
synonyms for open-brace and close-brace. 

The latest WG14/N117 says
   We decided to make the compound statement brackets digraphs,
   finding 'begin' and 'end' too long to write and too likely to
   be found ''not in the spirit of C'' by large numbers
   of programmers.

This is one of the points of direct disagreement.  Each reader of
these documents will have to judge whether this claim of "too long
to write" and "not in the spirit of C" is sufficient ground for
causing ISO and ANSI C to diverge, and for causing the rewriting of
all existing parsers.

All I can say is, this is a purely aesthetic argument here,
not having ANYTHING to do with decisions of SC22 about accomodating
ISO 646.  It seems unlikely to me that SC22 would have any objection
to the names  begin  and  end .

In my experience of the industry, among those projects which make the
(misguided) attempt to make C look more like prior languages, these
names ( begin  and  end ) are the most common synonyms.

7.  Generally agreed:
"The trigraph representation of  ??/  is unatractive but adequate."

The S&S papers make no proposals to use anything but the trigraph.

8.  Not agreed (from my alternative in 88-108):
"A macro -- named  sub  for example -- is adequate for subscript  [n]."

In my paper 88-108, I proposed that  SUB(n)  was an adequate alternative
for subscript.  Since then, the C++ style has favored lower-case
symbols, and the S&S papers have always used them.  So suppose, then,
that the proposal were revised to say  sub(n) .

There is no discussion in N117 addressing the question of why an
entirely new operator needs to be introduced to solve the readability
problem of square brackets.  As with point 6 above, the justification
for this new operator needs to be sufficiently compelling to force the
ANSI and ISO standards to diverge, and to cause the rewriting of all
existing parsers.

9.  Not agreed (from my objections in 88-108):
"The proposed subscription symbol  !  is technically flawed."

It was pointed out in 88-108, and independently elsewhere, that the
proposed new symbol, exclamation-mark, used for subscription in
expressions and for the "array-of" declarator, has a technical flaw
in its usage for the empty-brackets declarator context.  It requires
acceptance of an empty-expression  ()  operand  (as in  argv!() )
as well as an entirely-missing operand (as in  argv! ).  This latter
situation essentially adds the exclamation-mark as a postfix symbol,
as well as infix (as well, of course, as the original prefix usage).

N117 contains no discussion that addresses these long-standing
technical problems.

10.  Not agreed (from my alternative in 88-108):
"The empty-brackets declarator can be handled by a macro name."

In 88-108 I suggested that  SUBSUB  could suffice for the
empty-brackets context.  I had no attachment to the particular name;
any will do.  It could be lower-case just as well as upper-case.

There is no discussion in N117 giving any reasons why a macro name
is not adequate for the empty-brackets declarator context.

SUMMARY:

We agree on several points.

I am expressing here the entirely personal opinion that a pure
extension to existing C could be adopted by WG14, in the form of
a header, named for example  <iso646.h>  .

o  This would not invalidate any existing translators.

o  It could be specified in the Normative Addendum authorized by
   SC22 to address character set issues.

o  It avoids the technical flaw that has not yet been addressed in
   the S&S papers.

o  It would achieve the stated goals of the S&S papers, a more
   readable representation of C programs in ISO 646.

o  If a "readability" header were to be adopted by WG14 in its Normative
   Addendum, it is immensely more likely that ANSI X3J11 would also
   adopt it, to preserve the situation of identical ANSI and ISO
   Standards for C, relative to the major changes in the S&S papers.

o  In my limited and biased opinion, it is more likely to be adopted
   by ANSI X3J16 (standardizing C++) than a proposal which alters
   the lexical syntax, the declarator syntax, and the expression
   syntax of all existing Base Documents for the C++ Standard.

Good paper.  While you didn't emphasize it, my position is that any
ISO "normative addendum" must be one that is permitted as an extension
by the ANSI C standard.  Certainly <iso646.h> would be one such method.

Dear collegues,

I would like to bring another issue about character handling in C 
to your attention. This is concerning the use of non-ASCII letters
in identifiers. 

This is requested in the SC22 ad hoc WG on character sets.
I think it is a fair request.
One very simple solution to it was to allow all alphabetic
characters of the compiling locale to be used in identifiers.
Can it be done just as clean and simple as that?

I have felt Japanese would feel happy if we could use Kanji Characters
for identifiers.  But I know the barrier in the Principle,
 "C is English"

I wonder it means that we won't be able to compile Japanese source
codes with US compilers.

I think there is no problem from the view of localization.  But from
the view of I18N, we will lose source code portability between
different locales, which we now have on the current ANSI/ISO-C.

I find an idea to prepare for several levels of conformance;

1) Domestic conformance: we can use 'all alphabetic characters of the
   compiling locale to be used in identifiers'.  Of course, no
   portability between different locales is ensured.

2) I18n conformance: we can use only all alphabetic characters in the
   Basic Character Set in identifiers.

How do English people feel about our approach?

Subject: info re NIST

This is an information request to the e-mail list of X3J11.

After our recent negotiations at the US National Institute of
Standards and Technology (NIST), I have begun to wonder whether
they have consulted any C experts in their choice of test suites.

If any of you have been asked by them to help evaluate the technical
merit of test suites for C, would you be so kind as to let me
know that you have done so.  (I would understand, of course, that
any actual results of evaluation would be private information.)

This is a matter of major importance to us, and it would take only
a few seconds of your time.

Subject: Request for interpretation of (f)scanf in DIS9899
Date: Sat Aug 25 16:49:27 JST 1990
X-Charset: ASCII
X-Char-Esc: 29


Dear C language Experts,

This is a request for interpretation of the DIS9899 or ANSI/C Standard.

Could anyone clarify the rationale or forward this request to the
appropriate committee/people?

This request has been raised during the Japanese SC22/C Committee
meeting held in August, targeting the submission of our next draft of
Multibyte Support Extension to the ISO SC22/WG14 Copenhagen meeting.


It is unclear how the (f)scanf function shall behave when executing
directives that include "ordinary multibyte characters", especially
in the case of shift-encoded ordinary multibyte characters.

The following statements are described in "Section 4.9.6.2 The fscanf
Function" of the current Standard.

	: A directive that is an ordinary multibyte character is executed
	: by reading the next characters of the stream.  If one of the
	: characters differs from one comprising the directive, the
	: directive fails, and the differing and subsequent characters
	: remain unread.

Assume a typical shift encoded directive: A-UMLAUT in 7 bit representation.
And, consider two different encoding systems; Latin Alphabet No.1 - 8859/1,
and German Standard DIN 66 003. The codes are, for example,

	A-UMLAUT in 8859/1 :		SO 4/4 SI
	A-UMLAUT in DIN 66 003 :	ESC 2/8 4/11 5/11 ESC 2/8 4/2

	where, SO is a Shift-Out code (0/15 = 0x0f) and SI corresponds to
	a Shift-In code (0/14).  "ESC 2/8 4/11" is an escape sequence for
	the German Standard DIN 66 003, and "ESC 2/8 4/2" is for ISO 646
	USA Version (ASCII).

Assuming that a subject sequence includes A-UMLAUT, O-UMLAUT and
U-UMLAUT with the following 7 bit representations,

	In 8859/1	:	SO 4/4 5/6 5/12 SI
	In DIN 66 003	:	ESC 2/8 4/11 5/11 5/12 5/13 ESC 2/8 4/2

does the "A-UMLAUT" directive in the (f)scanf format string match the
beginning part of the "A-UMLAUT O-UMLAUT U-UMLAUT" sequence?

At what position of the target sequence shall the "A-UMLAUT" directive
fail?

One interpretation is that because the current Standard defined the
behavior of the directive in the (f)scanf format based on the word
"character"(byte), not using the word "multibyte character",
the comparison shall be done on byte-by-byte basis.  This may conclude
that the "A-UMLAUT" directive never match the "A-UMLAUT O-UMLAUT U-UMLAUT"
sequence in this case.

Another interpretation may lead to a reverse conclusion, saying that
the current Standard statements quoted above do not necessarily
mean that such comparison shall be done on byte-by-byte basis.
Instead, it is read that the matching shall be done on "multibyte
character by multibyte character basis" or rather "wide character by
wide character basis".  Especially, a "ghost" sequence like "ESC ..."
and SI/SO characters should not be regarded as independent ordinary
multibyte characters in this case.

Which is a correct interpretation of the current Standard?

These different interpretations are caused by the ambiguity of the
current Standard descriptions.  Also, it would be pointed out that
the major problem here is usage of the word "character". 
The generic word "character" and the specific word "character(=byte)"
should be properly discriminated in the Standard.

In any case, would you all, especially U.S.A. representatives and U.K.
representatives, please respond to the question?
Any your comments and suggestions are welcome.

If there are good rationale on this subject in the ANSI X3J11 Committee
or in the ISO/SC22/WG14 Committee, please let us know as soon as possible.
It would be greatly appreciated, as the Japanese SC22/C Committee is now
finalizing our MSE proposal including enhancement of the (f)scanf
functionality for wide characters.

Thank you for your consideration of this matter.

IMHO, it doesn't matter.  Any of the library functions can set errno,
even for successful returns, unless they explicitly set errno.  This
was because people wanted a fast, clunky atof which is not required to
set errno, and a more reasonable function that does set errno.

                    Issues re NIST Test Suite

The Procurement at NIST for a C test suite is still in  progress,
as  far  as  I  know.  As of now, Plum Hall Inc has withdrawn its
proposal for several reasons, and requested that the Solicitation
be withdrawn and revised.

Many of the issues are business reasons relating to high start-up
costs  with  no compensation.  These business issues are of vital
interest to Plum Hall Inc, and to any future marketplace for test
suites,  but  they are not directly relevant to X3J11.  In a nut-
shell, the NIST award may go to whomever is willing to provide  a
year's  free  service to the NIST.  I have copies of our detailed
statement, and will supply them upon request.

However, some issues are directly relevant to X3J11, and  to  the
future  of  the  control of the C language.  The NIST procurement
did not specify that the technically-best  test  suite  would  be
selected,  and to the best of my knowledge no C experts have been
consulted in assessing  the  technical  quality  of  the  suites.
(Actually,  a  last-minute  amendment  grouped  all the mandatory
business requirements under the guise of "technical", so that  it
appears  that 80% of the evaluation is "technical".)  In my obvi-
ously very-biased opinion, X3J11 has an interest in  seeing  that
the NIST test suite for C is of proper technical quality.

A second issue is the way the NIST is interpreting  its  mandate.
The  FIPS  (Federal  Information  Processing  Standard) is the US
Government's procurement standard, and the Solicitation specifies
that  this may diverge from ANSI or ISO standards at any point in
the future, under procedures subject to the sole control of NIST.
After such divergence, the NIST suite would validate FIPS C only.
I believe the mandate should be to validate nationally or  inter-
nationally  recognized  standards,  i.e.  ANSI  or  ISO, with the
best-quality test method, subject to  one  international  control
committee not controlled by one single organization.

These issues need to be examined by the industry and  the  users.
Many alternative scenarios are possible, but one very real possi-
bility is that the situation will drift into  one  in  which  one
agency of the US Government effectively controls the evolution of
the de-facto standards for C.

FYI, I just received the following e-mail from Perennial, one of the 
contenders for the NIST validation suite selection.

As far as I can tell there were only 3 final contenders: Perennial, 
Plum Hall, and HCR/ACE. According to reliable sources, Plum Hall 
withdrew their bid in the last several weeks citing major problems 
with the selection criteria and other issues. Around the same time, 
HCR/ACE aparently withdrew their bid since they thought the 
competition was biased toward Plum Hall. So, that left only Perennial.

I have a feeling that the dust has not yet settled and there will
likely be one or more appeals.  I'll keep you informed as I find out
more information.

If you were not already aware, the European C Validation service (UK, 
France, and Italy) selected Plum Hall for their suite, more than a 
year ago.

Just a note to let you know that Perennial has been selected
by the National Inst of Standards and Technology (NIST) has
selected Perennial to be the exclusive supplier of the
validation test suite for ANSI C - soon to be adopted as
 a Federal Information Processing (FIP) Standard.

On request from Japanese C representatives I registered a a formal
Request for Interpretation (number 18).  I also took copies to last
week's X3J11 meeting.  Unfortunately, the committee did NOT get to
review and process all submitted requests and, unfortunately, #18
was one of those left unresolved.  There will be no formal review of
it until the next meeting in March of 1991.  The only way to get
informal input before then is to directly ask members of X3J11. 

If you have an interest in multibyte character issues look for #18 in 
your next mailing (if you didn't get a copy last week) and send me any 
input you can. I'll forward it on to the Japanese.

Re your trigraph comments:

I think it must be stated that ``Trigraphs are already part of the
ANSI C standard on which IS 9899 is based.  They were added to
provide a mechanical way of converting conforming programs into and
out of ISO 646 environments, and in that respect, do their intended 
job.''

To say that `The trigraph notation is not well-liked'' is misleading
in this context.  Certainly, there are few people who think trigraphs
are elegant.  And most people think they are quite unnecessary.  It
is generally acknowledged, however, that they do the job they were
designed for.  It should be made clear that ONLY ONE WG14 member
dislikes them enough to seriously propose an alternative (and extra)
representation. Your report should in no way imply that an alternate 
representation is the desire of WG14 as a whole.

Hi Rex!

Thanks for your comments to my report.

I think your statement on the workings of trigraphs is included
in the report, just with other words. Nobody is saying that
trigraphs does not work.

On the alternate trigraph proposal: This was just described
as a proposal, and no opinion of WG14 was attached to it,
as support from WG14 has been varying...

"Support from WG14" has hardly been varying.  The trigraph alternative
proposal was brought up for a vote in WG14 and was defeated.  In any
reasonable consensus process that would be the end of the matter.

The support from WG14 has been varying: three times it has been put
to a vote for WG14, two times it passed, and once it did not pass.

                       Proposing <wchar.h>

I am personally persuaded of the importance of the Multibyte Sup-
port Extension proposed by the ITSCJ.

It appears to have the necessary generality to allow  C  programs
to be written to be able to support any of the planet-Earth char-
acter sets.

It provides enough functionality that programs can  use   wchar_t
as  a  basic  data  type,  performing I/O, classification, string
manipulation, etc, consistently within this type.

My only suggestion would be to request that, as discussed in  the
Multibyte  Rationale  section  2.4.2,  alternative  iii  -- a new
header file -- be adopted as the location for all the new  proto-
types.  For discussion purposes, I propose the name <wchar.h> .

My reasons concern issues of the format of standards, and of con-
sideration for existing tutorial materials.

The ISO  Normative  Addendum  will  provide  extra  pages  to  be
attached to the ISO Standard for C.  It will make a more coherent
document if those extra pages constitute an extra section for the
Library  documentation,  one  which  describes a new, internally-
coherent set of capabilities.  The other  approach  --  modifying
the existing header files -- will produce an Addendum which modi-
fies bits and pieces of the Library sections.

Providing an addendum header will have less impact upon  existing
tutorial  materials -- manuals, seminars, textbooks.  This is the
less confrontational approach.

[These are the personal observations of one  individual  partici-
pant, not official positions of X3J11, WG14, or X3J16.]

I agree that a new header is needed for (almost) all the new prototypes,
and <wchar.h> seems like a reasonable name for such a header.

As you may know, the most recent proposal from Stroustrup continues to
promote alternate spellings for { and }, using (: and :), respectively. 
It ocurred to me that these spellings might not be a good idea.

Consider the following program which I believe is ANSI/ISO C conforming. 
Granted, such code isn't likely to exist very much (if at all) but 
nevertheless, it IS sanctioned by the standards.

#include <stdio.h>

#define M(arg) printf("arg is >" #arg "<\n")

main()
{
	M(: :);
	M(| |);
	M(; ;);
}

arg is >: :<
arg is >| |<
arg is >; ;<

Since you can put pretty much any preprocessing token in a macro argument,
most new spellings of tokens that BEGIN with ( or END with ) can result in
either A QUIET CHANGE TO, OR THE INTRODUCTION OF AN ERROR IN, EXISTING
STANDARD-CONFORMING PROGRAMS.  I don't think this is a good thing to do,
politically, particularly if this proposal is supposed to be adopted by ISO 
only 2 years after the first ISO standard comes out.

Also, it precludes a program using these new digraphs for { and } from also 
calling a macro as shown above. Of course, you could always make the call
M( : : ) so there is space separating the characters but that seems a bit 
of a kludge.

Since the pairs {} and [] require trigraphs and I'm suggesting that () may 
not be usable either, what about <: and :>? Does this conflict with any 
prior art? (Actually, as soon as I wrote this suggestion I recalled that 
Microsoft's V6 compiler added the :> operator for based pointer stuff. Oh 
well ...)

NIST is requesting people to beat on the Perennial suite they selected for
US Govt acceptence testing and issued a request for participation Nov
15.  Unfortunately, I only found out about it this Monday and applications
close this Friday Dec 14.  I will be forwarding something like the
attached message to NIST by email and post requesting to be an initial and
ongoing reviewer of the suite.

If you don't have the same letter I have you will likely be too late to 
also participate since the form attached to it is supposed to be mailed in 
too. However, I am enclosing the email address of Kathryn Miles at NIST; 
she is the contact person there. If you REALLY want to particpate and this 
is the first you have heard about this, I urge you to send an email 
application to her IMMEDIATELY.

------------------------------------------------------------------
To Kathryn Miles, NIST
uunet!miles@ecf.ncsl.nist.gov


Kathryn, you may recall we have spoken several times re C validation. 
Unfortunately, Arnold only sent me the `Request for Comments' announcement
Monday and it arrived today.  I VERY MUCH want to be one of the 20
trial-use licensees and will mail in the form and letter tomorrow.  It
might even reach you by the deadline on Friday.

Briefly, I think I am very well qualified to evaluate a suite and to
suggest improvements.  I represent quite a broad audience in the C world. 
I am an independent computer consultant, author, and seminar leader and
have the following C involvement:

++ A voting member of the ANSI C Standards Committee X3J11
++ The US International Representative to ISO C
++ Convener and Chairman of the Numerical C Extensions Group (NCEG) 
   (recently adopted as working group X3J11.1)

++ Publisher and Editor of The Journal of C Language Translation (aimed at 
   C compiler developers)
++ C Editor of DEC PROFESSIONAL
++ Contributing Editor for The C User's Journal
++ ANSI C columnist for the Programmers Journal

++ Author of numerous books including "Portability and the C
   Language", Hayden, 1988; and "Mastering Standard C", Professional 
   Press, 1989.

++ I teach introductory, advanced, and portability C seminars on a regular 
   basis, stressing the importance of standards along the way

My book on portability mentions a small test suite I developed myself and
one which I have licensed free of charge to more than 100 companies and
individuals.  I use this suite to do a `rough' ANSI C conformance review
of new compilers and so far, have broken EVERY one tested.  Interestingly,
most of these vendors claim to have sucessfully passed a commercial suite
such as that from Plum Hall or Perennial.  Over the years I have written
many tests to check out the dark corners of the language and I plan to
continue doing so.

With my many and varied involvements with C I have a vested interest in
the sucess of the current and future ANSI and ISO C standards and their
conformance validation processes.

I have about 12 compilers all running under native 16-bit PC/MS-DOS or in 
extended mode on 386s under a DOS 32-bit extender. I expect to receive 2 or 
3 new ones in the next few months.

As Editor of the Journal of C Language Translation and a member of X3J11
and ISO C's WG14 I am also in a position to inform the vendor community of
suite validation issues and to help get and collate their input. I can do 
likewise with the user community via my user-oriented columns.

I look forward to the opportunity to work with you in this matter.

Sincerely,

------------------------------------------------------------------

What is the result  of:  strtod( "100ergs", &ptr);?  Is it 100.0 or is
it 0.0?
 
ANSI  C X3.159-1989,  4.10.1.4 The  strtod Function,  page 151,  lines
36-38:   'The  subject  sequence is  defined  as  the longest  initial
subsequence   of  the   input   string,   starting  with   the   first
non-white-space character,  that is  of the expected  form.'   In this
case, the longest  initial subsequence of the expected  form is "100",
so 100.0 should be the return value.  Also, since the entire string is
in memory,  strtod can scan it  as many times  as need be to  find the
longest valid initial subsequence.
 
ANSI  C X3.159-1989,  4.9.6.2  The fscanf  Function,  page 137,  lines
17-18:   'e,f,g Matches  an optionally  signed floating-point  number,
whose format  is the same  as expected for  the subject string  of the
strtod function.'   Later,  page 139, lines  6, 16,  and 25  show that
'100ergs'  fails to  match "%f".   Those  two show  that '100ergs'  is
invalid to fscanf  and therefore, invalid to strtod.   Then, page 152,
lines 11-12  'If no conversion could  be performed, zero  is returned'
indicates for an error input, 0.0 should be returned.  The reason this
is  invalid  is  spelled  out in  the  Rationale, 4.9.6.2  The  fscanf
function,  page 95,  'One-character  pushback  is sufficient  for  the
implementation  of  fscanf.    Given  the  invalid  field  "-.x",  the
characters "-."  are not  pushed back.'   And later,  'The conversions
performed by fscanf are compatible with  those performed by strtod and
strtol.'
 
So, do  strtod and fscanf  act alike and both  accept and fail  on the
same inputs,  by the one-character  pushback scanning strategy,  or do
they use  different scanning  strategies and  strtod accept  more than
fscanf?

Assuming that 99999 is larger than  DBL_MAX_10_EXP, what is the result

What is meant by 'representable  floating-point value'?  Assume double
precision, unless stated otherwise.
 
First, some definitions based partially  upon the floating-point model
on pages 15-16 of ANSI C X3.159-1989:
 
1)  +Normal Numbers:  DBL_MIN to DBL_MAX, inclusive; normalized (first
    significand digit is non-zero), sign is +1.
2)  -Normal Numbers:  -DBL_MAX to -DBL_MIN, inclusive; normalized.
3)  +Zero:  All digits zero, sign is +1; (true zero).
4)  -Zero:  All digits zero, sign is -1.
5)  Zero:  Union of +zero and -zero.
6)  +Denormals:   Exponent  is "minimum"  (Biased  exponent is  zero);
    first significand digit is  zero; sign is +1.  These  are in range
    +DBL_DeN (inclusive) to +DBL_MIN (exclusive).   Let DBL_DeN be the
    symbol for the minimum denormal, so we can talk about it by name.
7)  -Denormals:    Same  as  +denormals, except  sign,  and  range  is
    -DBL_MIN (exclusive) to -DBL_DeN (inclusive).
8)  +Unnormals:  Biased exponent is  non-zero; first significand digit
    is zero;  sign is  +1.  These  overlap the  range of  +normals and
    +denormals.
9)  -Unnormals:    Same as  +unnormals,  except  sign; range  is  over
    -normals and -denormals.
10) +infinity:  From IEEE-754.
11) -infinity:  From IEEE-754.
12) Quiet NaN (Not a Number); sign does not matter; from IEEE-754.
13) Signaling NaN; sign does not matter; from IEEE-754.
14) NaN: Union of Quiet NaN and Signaling NaN.
15) Others:  Reserved (VAX?) and Indefinite (CDC/Cray?) act like NaN.
 
On the real number line, these symbols order as:
 
  [  1  )[   2    ](   3   ]( 4 )[ 5 ]( 6 )[   7   )[   8    ](  9  ]
  +------+--------+--------+-----+---+-----+--------+--------+------+
-INF -DBL_MAX -DBL_MIN -DBL_DeN -0  +0 +DBL_DeN +DBL_MIN +DBL_MAX +INF
 
Non-real numbers are:  SNaN, QNaN, and NaN, call this region 10.
 
Regions 1 and 9 are overflow, 2 and  8 are normal numbers, 3 and 7 are
denormal numbers (psuedo underflow), 4 and 6 are true underflow, and 5
is zero.
 
So,  the question  is:   What does  'representable (double  precision)
floating-point value' mean:
 
a) Regions 2, 5 and 8 (+/- normals and zero)
b) Regions 2, 3, 5, 7, and 8 (+/- normals, denormals, and zero)
c) Regions 2 through 8 [-DBL_MAX ... +DBL_MAX]
d) Regions 1 through 9 [-INF ... +INF]
e) Regions 1 through 10 (reals and non-reals)
f) What the hardware can represent
g) Something else?  What?
 
Some things to consider in  your answer  follow.   The questions  that
follow are rhetorical and do not need answers.
 
ANSI  C  X3.159-1989,  2.2.4.2.2  Characteristics  of  Floating  Types
<float.h>,  page 15,  lines 32-35,  'The  characteristics of  floating
types are defined in terms of  a model that describes a representation
of floating-point numbers and values that provide information about an
implementation's floating-point  arithmetic.'   Same section,  page 16
line 6,  'A normalized floating-point number  x ... is defined  by the
following model ...'.
 
    That model is just normalized numbers and zero (appears to include
    signed  zeros).    It  excludes  denormal  and  unnormal  numbers,
    infinities, and NaNs.  Are signed zeros required, or just allowed?
 
ANSI C X3.159-1989, 3.1.3.1 Floating  Constants, page 27, lines 32-35,
'If the scaled value is in the  range of representable values (for its
type) the  result is  either the nearest  representable value,  or the
larger  or smaller  representable value  immediately  adjacent to  the
nearest value, chosen in an implementation-defined manner.'
 
    ------+-----+------+--------+----...----+-----+---
          A     B y    C x      D           E  z  F
      -DBL_Den 0.0 +DBL_Den +DBL_MIN ... DBL_MAX INF
 
    The representable numbers are A,B,C,D,E and F. The number x can be
    converted to  B, C, or  D!  But  what if B  is zero, C  is DBL_DeN
    (denormal), and  D is DBL_MIN  (normalized).  Is  x representable?
    It is  not in the range  DBL_MIN...DBL_MAX and its  inverse causes
    overflow; so those say not valid.  On the other hand, it is in the
    range DBL_DeN...DBL_MAX and it does  not cause underflow; so those
    say it is valid.
 
    What if  B is zero,  A is -DBL_DeN  (denormal), and C  is +DBL_DeN
    (denormal).   Is y  representable?   If so,  its nearest  value is
    zero, and the immediately adjacent values include a positive and a
    negative number.  So a user written  positive is allowed to end up
    with a negative value!
 
    What if  E is DBL_MAX  and F is infinity  (on a machine  that uses
    infinities, IEEE-754)?   Does z have a representation?   If z came
    from 1.0/x,  then z caused  overflow which  says invalid.   But on
    IEEE-754  machines,  it  would  either   be  DBL_MAX  or  infinity
    depending upon  the rounding control,  so it has  a representation
    and is valid.
 
    What is nearest?   In linear or logarithmic sense?   If the number
    is between  0 and DBL_DeN, 1e-9999999  is linear nearest  to zero,
    but log nearest to DBL_DeN.  If number is between DBL_MAX and INF,
    1e+999999 is linear and log nearest  to DBL_MAX.  Or is everything
    bigger than DBL_MAX nearest to INF?
 
ANSI C X3.159-1989,  3.2.1.3 Floating and Integral,  page 36, footnote
29, 'Thus, the range of portable floating values is (-1,Utype_MAX+1).'
 
ANSI  C X3.159-1989,  3.2.1.4 Floating  Types, page  36, lines  11-15,
'When a  double is  demoted to  float or  a long  double to  double or
float, if  the value being  converted is  outside the range  of values

cannot be represented exactly, the result is either the nearest higher
or nearest lower value, chosen in an implementation-defined manner.'

exception occurs during  the evaluation of an expression  (that is, if
the  result is  not  mathematically defined  or not  in  the range  of

    w = 1.0 / 0.0 ;  /* infinity in IEEE-754 */
    x = 0.0 / 0.0 ;  /* NaN in IEEE-754 */
    y = +0.0 ;    /* plus zero */
    z = - y ;     /* minus zero: Must this be -0.0? May it be +0.0? */
 
    Are the above representable?
 
ANSI C  X3.159-1989, 4.5.1  Treatment of  Error Conditions,  page 112,
lines 11-12, 'The  behavior of each of these functions  is defined for
all representable values of its input arguments.'
 
    What  about  non-numbers?    Are  they  representable?    What  is
    sin(NaN);?  If you got a NaN as  input, then you can return NaN as
    output.  But,  is it a domain error?   Must errno be  set to EDOM?
    The NaN already indicates an error,  so setting errno adds no more
    information.   Assuming NaN is not  part of ANSI  C representable,
    but the hardware  supports it, then using NaNs is  an extension of
    ANSI C  and setting errno  need not  be required, but  is allowed.
    Correct?
 
ANSI C  X3.159-1989, 4.5.1  Treatment of  Error Conditions,  page 112,
lines 20-27,  'Similarly, a range  error occurs  if the result  of the
function  cannot be  represented as  a double  value.   If the  result
overflows (the magnitude of  the result is so large that  it cannot be
represented in an object of the  specified type), the function returns
the value of  the macro HUGE_VAL, with  the same sign (except  for the
tan function) as the  correct value of the function; the  value of the
macro  ERANGE is  stored  in errno.   If  the  result underflows  (the
magnitude of the result  is so small that it cannot  be represented in
an object of  the specified type), the function  returns zero; whether
the integer expression errno acquires the value of the macro ERANGE is
implementation-defined.'
 
    What about denormal numbers?  What  is sin(DBL_MIN / 3.0L);?  Must
    this be considered underflow and  therefore return zero, and maybe
    set errno to ERANGE?   Or may it return DBL_MIN  / 3.0, a denormal
    number?  Assuming denormals are not  part of ANSI C representable,
    but the hardware  supports it, then using them is  an extension of
    ANSI C  and setting errno  need not  be required, but  is allowed.
    Correct?
 
    What about  infinity?  What  is exp(INF);?  If  you got an  INF as
    input, then  you can  return INF as  output.  But,  is it  a range
    error?  The output value is  representable, so that says no error.
    The output value is bigger than DBL_MAX, so that says an error and
    set errno  to ERANGE.   Assuming infinity  is not  part of  ANSI C
    representable, but the hardware supports it, then using INFs is an
    extension of ANSI C and setting errno need not be required, but is
    allowed.  Correct?
 
    What about  signed zeros?  What  is sin(-0.0);?  Must  this return
    -0.0?   May it  return -0.0?   May it return  +0.0?   Signed zeros
    appear to be required in the model on page 16.
 
    What  is  sqrt(-0.0);?    IEEE-754  and  IEEE-854  (floating-point
    standards) say  this must  be -0.   Is -0.0 negative?   Is  this a
    domain error?
 
ANSI  C X3.159-1989,  4.9.6.1 The  fprintf Function,  page 133,  lines
32-33, '(It  will begin  with a  sign only  when a  negative value  is
converted if this flag is not specified.)'
 
    What is fprintf(stdout, "%+.1f", -0.0);?  Must it be -0.0?  May it
    be +0.0?  Is -0.0 a negative value?   The model on page 16 appears
    to require support for signed zeros.
 
    What is  fprintf(stdout, "%f %f", 1.0/0.0,  0.0/0.0);?  May  it be
    the IEEE-854 strings  of 'inf' or 'infinity' for  the infinity and
    'NaN' the  quiet NaN?   Would 'NaNQ' also  be allowed for  a quiet
    NaN?  Would 'NaNS' be allowed for  a signaling NaN?  Must the sign
    be printed?   Signs are  optional in  IEEE-754 and IEEE-854.   Or,
    must it  be some decimal notation  as specified by page  134, line
    19.  Does the locale matter?
 
ANSI C X3.159-1989, 4.10.1.4 The strtod Function, page 152, lines 1-2,
'If the subject sequence begins with a minus sign, the value resulting
from the conversion is negated.'
 
    What is strtod("-0.0", &ptr);?  Must it  be -0.0?  May it be +0.0?
    The model on page 16 appears  to require support for signed zeros.
    All floating-point hardware  I know about support  signed zeros at
    least at the load, store, and negate/complement instruction level.
 
ANSI  C X3.159-1989,  4.10.1.4 The  strtod Function,  page 152,  lines
12-15, 'If  the correct  value is outside  the range  of representable
values, plus or  minus HUGE_VAL is returned (according to  the sign of
the value), and the value of the macro  ERANGE is stored in errno.  If
the correct  value would  cause underflow,  zero is  returned and  the
value of the macro ERANGE is stored in errno.'
 
    If HUGE_VAL is +infinity, then is strtod("1e999999",&ptr); outside
    the range of representable values and a range error?  Or is it the
    'nearest' of DBL_MAX and INF?
