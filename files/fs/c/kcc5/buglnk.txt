Ken, I have a .cmd file called <nicprog>hstreg.cmd that i just "take"
to compile the hstreg program.  I works fine if I am connected to nicprog:
but if I am connected elsewhere with another (local) version of hstreg.c
and "take nicprog:hstreg.cmd" I get a linker error:  
	%LNKCOF  Cannot open file DSK:IDBSUP.REL

do you know why?

It looks like KCC is not passing along the "n:" part of the args when it
gives them to LINK.  In general, MACRO and LINK cannot handle directory
names, which is why KCC doesn't bother.  But they do use logical names
(the crock DEC invented to make TOPS-10 software work on TOPS-20) and
I guess KCC should understand that.  For the time being you'll have
to connect to the directory those .REL files are in; I'll fix the
bug later.
