   The TOPS-20 Commands Reference Manual  is  an  alphabetically-arranged
   description of all operating system commands (EXEC commands) available
   to the non-privileged timesharing user of TOPS-20.

   In addition, there are two appendixes for quick reference - a list  of
   commands  grouped by function, and an alphabetical summary of commands
   showing what variety of argument each uses  and  whether  it  calls  a
   program or otherwise affects memory.

              _______ ________  _________  ______   To use the TOPS-20 Commands  Reference  Manual  properly,  you  should
                             _______ _______ ____ _______         _______   first read and understand Getting Started With TOPS-20 and the TOPS-20

                                INTRODUCTION                                INTRODUCTION



   COMMANDS AND ARGUMENTS   COMMANDS AND ARGUMENTS

   A complete TOPS-20 command consists of the command  name  and  usually
   one  or  more arguments.  In the most general sense, arguments are any
   combinations  of  letters,  numerals,  punctuation  marks  and   other
   characters that you type after the command name itself to complete the
   meaning of the command.  These arguments can be  file  specifications,
   switches,  subcommands,  and  values  for switches and subcommands, as
   well as words and numbers (the  arguments  to  the  SET  and  TERMINAL
   commands,   for   example).    The  following  pages  contain  general
   information about each variety of argument.


   File Specifications   File Specifications

   Information and programs for TOPS-20 are usually  stored  in  uniquely
   labeled  files.  Therefore, file specifications or "filespecs" are the
   most common variety  of  argument  to  a  command.   A  complete  file
   specification is of the form

        dev:<dir>name.typ.gen;att;...;att

   where

        dev:  is a device (usually a file structure)

|       <dir> is a directory name (enclosed in angle < >  or  square  [ ]
|       brackets)

        name is a filename

        .typ is a file type

        .gen is a generation number

        ;att is a file attribute


                                    xiii
                           COMMANDS AND ARGUMENTS                           COMMANDS AND ARGUMENTS


   You need file attributes in only a few situations and can usually  let
   dev:,  <dir>, and .gen take default values (that is, values defined by
   the state of your job   -  see the Special Features section below), so
|  you can give most file specifications in the shortened form, name.typ,
   without being unclear.  In a few cases, an entire  file  specification
   is assumed if you do not supply one when you give the command (for the
   CREATE  and  EDIT  commands,   for   example,   and   for   LOAD-class
   commands - COMPILE, LOAD, EXECUTE, and DEBUG).

   Whenever you omit the dev:  field of the filespec, the system  assumes
   you  mean  your  connected  structure  (DSK:).   This  is  the  public
   structure (usually named PS:), which all users must log in to,  unless
   you  connect  to a directory on another structure by using the CONNECT
   command.  Give the INFORMATION STRUCTURE command if you are unsure  of
   the name for your connected structure.

   Whenever you omit the <dir> field of the filespec, the system  assumes
   you  mean  your  connected directory.  Unless you have given a CONNECT
   command, this is your "log-in" directory, the directory on the  public
   structure  that  you  must  log  in  to  and  which usually has a name
   composed of your surname, or surname and initials, enclosed  in  angle
   brackets.   You  change  your  connected directory by giving a CONNECT
   command.  Use the DIRECTORY command to see the name of your  connected
   directory.

   When you omit the .gen  field  of  the  filespec  the  system  usually
   assumes you mean the highest generation (largest generation number) of
   the  file.   (A  few  commands,  for  example,  DELETE,  RENAME,   and
   DIRECTORY,  act  on  all  generations  of  a file unless you specify a
   particular generation.)  When you create and edit text files,  compile
   and  debug programs, or do anything else to produce another generation
   of a file, the system automatically works with  the  highest  existing
   generation and labels the changed file with the next higher generation
   number.  Therefore when you omit the generation number in  a  filespec
   given  as  argument to a TOPS-20 command, you are assured of using the
   most recent version of the  file.   Although  you  can  override  this
   default  action  by  specifying  particular  generations  of input and
   output files, it is simplest and most  straightforward  to  allow  the
   defaults to prevail.

   Specification  of  file  attributes  is  optional.   You  can   assign
   attributes  in  order to have a file automatically marked for deletion
   when you log out; to associate a file with a  valid  account;  and  so
   forth.  Appendix C lists the available file attributes.

   Pressing the ESC key instead of typing a filespec field  will  usually
   cause  any  default  for  the  remaining  fields to be printed on your
   terminal.

   There are two characters (called "wildcard" characters) that  you  can
   include  in  any field of a filespec to include all files matching the
   rest of the filespec.  An asterisk (*)  fills  in  for  zero  or  more


                                    xiv
                           COMMANDS AND ARGUMENTS                           COMMANDS AND ARGUMENTS


   characters  of a field, while a percent sign (%) fills in for a single
   character only.  (However, only the complete field "DSK*:" is  allowed
   as  wildcard  for the device field, and only the complete field "*" is
   allowed as wildcard for the generation field.)   Therefore  you  could
   give the command DIRECTORY *.CBL to find out what source files written
   in COBOL are in your connected directory, or the command  DELETE  *.Q*
   to remove the EDIT program's backup files from your directory.


   Switches   Switches

   Switches are arguments used with LOAD-class (COMPILE,  LOAD,  EXECUTE,
   and  DEBUG) and EDIT-class (CREATE and EDIT) commands, as well as with
   Queue-class commands - that is, those affecting entries in  processing
   queues  (CANCEL,  DISMOUNT,  MODIFY,  MOUNT,  PLOT,  PRINT, PUNCH, and
   SUBMIT).

   Switches can also be used with the following program-control commands:
   DDT,  GET,  MERGE,  R,  and  RUN.   The  REWIND command also accepts a
   switch.

   Switches allow you to give quickly many options chosen  from  a  large
   list, and let you specify to which files they apply when you give more
   than one filespec in a single command.

   Give switches on the same line as the  command,  typing  a  slash  (/)
   before  each  switch.   If  your  command requires more than one line,
   simply keep typing without giving a carriage return.  The system  will
   begin  a  new  line automatically and will read your command as if you
   had typed it on a single line.  Or you may end your  command  line  at
   any  point  with  a  hyphen  (-) and carriage return, and continue the
   command on the next line; the hyphen will not be  considered  part  of
   your input.

   Keep in mind  the  way  each  class  of  command  considers  switches.
   EDIT-class  commands  operate  on  only  one  file  at a time, and the
   switches must  be  given  before  the  input  filespec - this  is  the
   simplest case.

   Queue-class and LOAD-class commands treat switches according to  their
   position  in the command line.  If you give them before any filespecs,
   they act as default switches for all filespecs in  the  command  (they
   will  be  in  effect  unless  you  override  them  with later switches
   applying to individual files only).  If you give them after the  first
   filespec,  they  apply only to the preceding file.  In addition, there
   are a few switches of a different sort for the PLOT, PRINT, and  PUNCH
   commands - these apply to all files no matter where they appear in the
   command line.  These are called job switches (because they affect  the
   entire  printing  job)  and  are presented in a separate list in those
   command descriptions.

   A switch is a default if the system  assumes  it  in  the  absence  of


                                     xv
                           COMMANDS AND ARGUMENTS                           COMMANDS AND ARGUMENTS


|  others.   For  LOAD-class  commands,  /FORTRAN  is the default for all
|  switches that specify which compiler to use (like /MACRO, /COBOL,  and
|  /PASCAL).    The  /NOCOMPILE  switch  is  the  default  for  /COMPILE,
   /NOCOMPILE, and /RELOCATABLE.  Most defaults for these commands  apply
   to  only  a  pair  of  switches;  however, the /BINARY, /NOSEARCH, and
   /NOOPTIMIZE switches are assumed,  for  example,  unless  you  specify
|  /NOBINARY, /SEARCH, and /OPTIMIZE.

   Default switches for the other classes of command  operate  similarly.
   Some  are  in  effect unless you specify their opposite; others are in
   effect with a default argument unless you  specify  another  argument;
   still  others must be specified to be in effect, but are supplied with
   a default argument.  The list of switches presented with each  command
   description  distinguishes  these  cases.   When  you give two or more
   switches of the same kind (for example, /BINARY  and  /NOBINARY),  the
   last switch given usually prevails.


   Subcommands   Subcommands

   Subcommands  are   a   variety   of   argument   used   chiefly   with
   DIRECTORY-class  (DIRECTORY,  FDIRECTORY,  TDIRECTORY, and VDIRECTORY)
   commands and with the BUILD command.  The  COPY  and  APPEND  commands
   share  a  small  group of subcommands that modify their operation, and
   ARCHIVE, DELETE, EXPUNGE, SYSTAT,  and  TAKE  each  have  subcommands.
   However, you usually employ these last nine commands without resorting
   to subcommands at all.

   If you  want  to  give  subcommands  to  any  of  the  DIRECTORY-class
   commands,  type  a  comma  at  the end of the command line just before
   pressing the carriage return.  After the system  prompts  you  with  a
   double  at  sign  (@@) you can give subcommands, one on each line.  If
   you give no subcommands to the DIRECTORY command, the ALPHABETICAL and
   HEADING  subcommands will be in effect, giving an alphabetical listing
   of files.  For a few subcommands, default arguments will be in  effect
   if  you  give  the  subcommands  without  supplying any.  You can give
   subcommands in any order, requesting or declining  special  categories
   of  information and specifying the format of its presentation.  If you
   give mutually exclusive subcommands (ALPHABETICAL  and  CHRONOLOGICAL,
   for  example)  the  last-given  subcommand  prevails.   Note  that the
   FDIRECTORY, TDIRECTORY, and VDIRECTORY commands are equivalent to  the
   DIRECTORY command with certain subcommands automatically included, and
   can be further modified with other subcommands from DIRECTORY's  list.
   To  cancel  a DIRECTORY-class command while giving subcommands, type a
   CTRL/C.

   The BUILD command operates differently from  DIRECTORY-class  commands
   in  putting you automatically into subcommand mode without your typing
   a final  comma  on  the  command  line,  and  in  offering  a  special
   subcommand to cancel the command while you are typing subcommands.

   See the individual command descriptions for more detailed  information

   about subcommands.


   Other Arguments   Other Arguments

   Some command arguments are not introduced by special  characters  such
   as  slashes  or  double  at  signs, but still are particular words, or
   "keywords," having a special meaning to the system.  Give these on the
   same line as the command itself, leaving at least one space before and
   between arguments.  Certain of these (for example,  the  LOGICAL-NAMES
   argument  to  the  INFORMATION  command) are actually composed of more
   than one word, joined by hyphens so that the system will not interpret
   them  as more than one argument.  If the complete command will not all
   fit onto one line,  simply  keep  typing:   the  system  automatically
   begins  a  new line when necessary, but interprets the typing as if it
   had all appeared on one line.  Or you may end a command  line  at  any
   point  with  a  hyphen  (-)  and  a  carriage return, and continue the
   command on the next line; the hyphen will not be  considered  part  of
   your input.

   A few command arguments must be accompanied by special symbols  to  be
   interpreted correctly.  Enclose directory names in angle brackets when
   using them with the CONNECT or names (for DEFINE), device names  (used
   with  ASSIGN),  and  structures  and  tape  sets  (used  with MOUNT or
   DISMOUNT) all require a  colon  at  the  end.   (But  note  that  when
   supplying  what  look like structure and tape set names to the related
   CANCEL command, you are supplying jobnames, and must not  include  the
   colon.)  If  you  punctuate a command argument incorrectly, the system
   will usually print a message reminding you of this.


   SPECIAL FEATURES   SPECIAL FEATURES

   Defaults   Defaults

   The concept of "defaults," or command arguments assumed  when  you  do
   not  specify  a  choice,  is  important for understanding TOPS-20.  To
   speed processing of commands and  to  help  inexperienced  users,  the
   system  uses  defaults when necessary for completing commands that you
   give.  By taking advantage of this defaulting action, you can make the
   system work faster and more efficiently for you.  This manual displays
   prominently  the  available  choices  of  command  arguments  and  the
   established defaults for these.

   There  are  different  kinds  of  default.    When   you   give   file
   specifications  as  arguments  to,  say, the PRINT command, the system
   assumes that you are referring to the highest (most recent) generation
   of  these  files  in your connected structure and connected directory.
   By specifying a different structure, directory, or generation you  can
   override  this  default,  but  only  if  you  already  have  the right
   (established by user membership in a group, perhaps,  or  by  a  prior
   ACCESS command) to do so.


                                    xvii
                           COMMANDS AND ARGUMENTS                           COMMANDS AND ARGUMENTS


   When you give the INFORMATION BATCH-REQUESTS command  without  further
   arguments,  you  are  presented  with a listing of all requests in the
   batch input queue.  The /USER switch allows you to limit this  display
   to  the  jobs  of  the  user  named.   If  you give the switch without
   supplying a user name, your own user name is used  as  default.   (But
   the  /USER  switch  to  the  related  SUBMIT  command  has meaning for
   privileged users only, who can use it to run batch  jobs  under  other
   user  names; for non-privileged users this switch effectively defaults
   to your own user name.)  Only a few command arguments behave like  the
   /USER switch.  The /TIME switch to the SUBMIT command is worth noting:
   by not giving the switch, you set a time limit of 5 minutes; by giving
   the  switch  without specifying a time limit, you are setting a 1-hour
   limit; and you can set  any  other  time  limit  by  supplying  it  as
   argument to the switch.

   Note that none of the three switches to INFORMATION BATCH-REQUESTS and
   INFORMATION  OUTPUT-REQUESTS  (/ALL,  /FAST,  and  /USER) is used as a
   default:  each calls for a listing that differs in some respects  from
   that  yielded  by  the  unmodified  command.   Howevr, the INFORMATION
   LOGICAL-NAMES command, which allows keywords ALL, JOB, and SYSTEM, has
   JOB  as default for these.  The list of arguments associated with each
   command makes these choices clear.

   To discover what default  argument  (if  any)  is  established  for  a
   switch,  subcommand,  or  other argument, press the ESC key instead of
   giving the argument:  the default will be printed on your terminal.


   Recognition   Recognition

   "Recognition" input is another feature of the TOPS-20 operating system
   that  speeds  up  your  input, by finishing the typing of a command or
   command argument for you when you have given only part of it and  then
   prompting your next response.

   As soon as  you  have  typed  enough  of  a  command  or  argument  to
   distinguish it from others, press the ESC key:  the system will finish
   the word, if possible, and prompt  your  next  input  with  guidewords
   enclosed  in  parentheses.   (Note  that  this  manual  does  not show
   guidewords except in the Format section of each command  description.)
   By  pressing  the  ESC  key without beginning an argument you make the
   system print the default argument, if there is  one.   If  the  system
   cannot  help  you, either because you have not typed enough characters
   to make your intentions clear or because there  is  no  default,  your
   terminal makes a warning noise - either a ringing bell or high-pitched
   beep.

   Because the ESC key does not produce a printed character, you  may  be
   unable  to  remember exactly where you pressed it when later examining
   the output from a hard-copy terminal.   If  you  want  to  avoid  this
   possibility,  use  the TERMINAL NO RAISE command to make your terminal
   produce lowercase input, to distinguish it from the uppercase printing

                           COMMANDS AND ARGUMENTS                           COMMANDS AND ARGUMENTS


   of the system.

   You  cannot  use  recognition  for  device   names   (including   file
   structures), jobnames (for example, with the MODIFY or CANCEL command)
   or logical names.


   Abbreviation   Abbreviation

   By abbreviating  commands  and  command  arguments,  you  can  further
   increase  the  speed with which you give instructions to TOPS-20.  The
   smallest unique abbreviation for a command or argument will stand  for
   the  entire  word; if there is a default choice for further arguments,
   the system  will  assume  you  want  this  too.   (You  can  determine
   sufficient   abbreviations  by  using  the  ESC  key:   any  correctly
   recognized abbreviation will stand for the  word.)  For  example,  the
   abbreviated command FD stands for the FDIRECTORY <connected directory>
   command; I L stands for INFORMATION (ABOUT) LOGICAL-NAMES (OF) JOB.

   There are a few cases  where  non-unique  abbreviations  stand  for  a
|  frequently  used  command.   For  example,  E  is the abbreviation for
|  EXAMINE, even though two other commands begin with the  letters  EX  -
|  EXECUTE and EXPUNGE.
|  
|                      Special
                       ____________        _______|                      Abbreviation        Command
|  
|                      CON                 CONTINUE
|  
|                      D                   DEPOSIT
|  
|                      DIS                 DISABLE
|  
|                      E                   EXAMINE
|  
|                      EX                  EXECUTE
|  When not logged in:
|                      LOG                 LOGIN
|  When logged in:
|                      LOG                 LOGOUT

   You cannot use abbreviation (or recognition)  in  a  few  cases.   The
   names of devices (including file structures), and jobnames (given, for
   example, as arguments to the MODIFY or CANCEL command) must  be  typed
   in full; and of course passwords cannot be abbreviated or recognized.


   Question Marks   Question Marks

   Whenever you type a question mark (?)  instead  of  (or  even  in  the
   middle  of) a TOPS-20 command or command argument, the system responds
   with instructions  or  a  list  of  possible  completions.   By  using


                                    xix
                           COMMANDS AND ARGUMENTS                           COMMANDS AND ARGUMENTS


   question  marks  and  recognition  when  you  are unsure of the proper
   command or argument, you can have the  system  help  you  during  your
   terminal session.

   These  features,  together  with  the  HELP  command,  which  provides
   information  on  various  system programs, are valuable supplements to
   the written documentation for TOPS-20.


   DATE-TIME ARGUMENTS   DATE-TIME ARGUMENTS

   You can specify date  and  time  arguments  to  many  of  the  TOPS-20
   commands.   The  following  sections  describe  the  formats for these
   arguments.


   Date   Date

   The examples below show the various formats that  are  acceptable  for
   the date argument:

        Jun 30 1981         30 Jun 1981
        May 1, 82           1/May/1982
        January 000005 75   0005-January-000075
        F/13-83             5/17/83

   If the month and day are both numeric, the first number of the two, if
   less  than  13,  is considered to be the month.  Otherwise, the second
   number is considered to be the month.  For example:

        2/15/83             is February 15th
        15/2/83             is February 15th

   You can abbreviate the month to as few characters as possible  without
   causing it to be confused with another month.  Thus,

        O
        Jun
        Jul
        Ja

   are acceptable abbreviations for October, June, July, and January.

   Many commands allow you to give the day of the week or "today" for the
   date.

   If you specify the time along with the date, you must separate the two
   arguments by at least one space and/or no more than one tab.


   Time   Time

   For the time argument you can specify:

        o  time according to a 24-hour clock:

                /AFTER:17:00:00

        o  AM and PM:

   Note that a hyphen (-) is required before the zone.

   The basic time format is:

        hh:mm:ss

   where:

        hh      is hours, must be less than 24, and is optional
        mm      is minutes, must be less than 60, and is required
        ss      is seconds, must be less than 60, and is optional

   The colon between hours and minutes is optional.

   Relative Date-Time Arguments   Relative Date-Time Arguments

   Many commands accept relative dates and times.  You can  specify  that
   an  event  is  to  occur  at a certain amount of time from the current
   time, from today, or from a certain day of the  week.   Likewise,  you
   can specify relative times in the past.


   Examples   Examples

        @SET ALERT +30      sets an alert for 30 minutes from now

        @DIRECTORY,         produces a listing of files that

   EXEC MESSAGES|  EXEC MESSAGES
|  
|  The TOPS-20 Command Processor, or EXEC, displays messages in  response
|  to  errors  or  other  conditions  that  arise  when using the TOPS-20
|  Command  Language.   Three  kinds  of  EXEC  messages  exist:   error,
|  warning, and information.
|  
|  Error messages begin with a  question  mark  (?).   An  error  message
|  indicates  that a failure has occurred and execution of the command or
|  program has stopped.  If, for example, you type the wrong password  in
                                                               ?Incorrect|  a  LOGIN  or  CONNECT  command,  you  receive  the  message ?Incorrect
   password|  password, and the command is not executed.
|  
|  Warning messages begin with percent sign (%).  A warning message  also
|  indicates that a failure has occurred, but execution of the command or
|  program usually continues.  For example, suppose you type the  command
|  DIRECTORY  *.PAS, *.REL to list all the files with the extensions .PAS
|  and .REL, and, your connected directory  does  not  contain  any  .REL
|  files.  The EXEC lists all the files with the .PAS extensions and then
                               %No such file type *.REL|  prints the warning message, %No such file type *.REL.
|  
|  The third type of message you can get from  the  EXEC  (and  sometimes
|  from  the system) is an information message.  Information messages are
|  enclosed in square brackets [ ] and inform you about the status of the
|  system  or  the  result  of an EXEC command.  For example, the message
   [DECSYSTEM-20 continued]|  [DECSYSTEM-20 continued] indicates that a temporary pause  in  service
                              [n pages freed]|  has  ended.   The  message [n pages freed] indicates that your EXPUNGE
|  command freed n disk pages.  Usually information messages  require  no
|  response from you.
|  
|  When you need more information than is provided by  an  EXEC  message,

             Your capabilities (such as  Wheel,  Operator,  Confidential)
             are associated with your log-in user name only.  If you give
             the ACCESS command for a directory  whose  owner  has  Wheel
             capabilities, say, you do not gain these capabilities.


   Restrictions


        One Directory Per Structure

             You can access only one directory at a time on each  mounted
             structure.   Each  ACCESS  command  ends any previous ACCESS
             command (including the implicit access obtained by the LOGIN
             command)   for   that  structure.   If  you  access  another


                                     1



             directory on the public structure you give up your own group
             rights on the public structure.  These are restored when you
             give an ACCESS command for your log-in directory.


        Not For Files-only Directories

             Because a files-only directory does not  have  an  owner  or
             user group rights, you cannot give an ACCESS command for it.
             Use CONNECT instead.


   Effect on Memory and Terminal


        The ACCESS  command  does  not  affect  memory  and  leaves  your
        terminal at TOPS-20 command level.

   ADVISE



   Links your terminal with another user's terminal so that you can  give
   commands to his job.  The advisee can still give commands to his job.


   Format


         ADVISE (USER) argument        @ADVISE (USER) argument

        where

        argument                 is either a user name or  terminal  line
                                 number.


   Characteristics


        Input to Other Job

             For as long as the ADVISE command is in effect, the commands
             you give affect the advisee's job instead of your own.

        Ending Advice

             To end  an  advising  link  that  you  have  formed  between
             terminals,  you must type CTRL/E.  This CTRL/E is not echoed
             on either terminal.

        Refused Advice

             Ordinarily, you cannot advise a job unless its  terminal  is
             set  to  receive  advice.   However,  if  you  have Wheel or
             Operator capabilities enabled, you can advise any job.


   Hints

        Help During Advise

|            Once you are advising another job, you can type CTRL/~?   to
             display a short list of special commands that can be used to
             send comments or control  characters,  or  to  relink  to  a
             terminal that has broken links with yours.

|            Note  that  the  tilde  character  (~)  can  have  different
|            meanings   with  various  terminal  models.   If  the  tilde
|            character fails to display help text, consult your  terminal


                                     4



|            manual  for  the  character  equivalent to 36 octal in ASCII
|            code.


   Special Cases


        Advisee Has More Than One Job

             If more than one job is logged in under the  user  name  you
             specify, the system gives you a list of that user's terminal
             numbers and associated programs to choose from, then  prints
             TTY:  to prompt your response.  Type your choice of terminal
             number after the prompt.

        Advising a Pseudoterminal (PTY:)

             If you try to advise a PTY:  the system informs you of  this
             and asks you to confirm with a carriage return.


   Restrictions


        Compatible Terminals

             Unless the terminals  involved  in  an  advising  link  have
             compatible characteristics (e.g., terminal width, ability to
             handle tabs and lowercase letters), some information can  be
             lost or overprinted.  To avoid this problem, the user of the
             faster or more capable terminal should adjust his terminal's
             characteristics,  if  possible  before the ADVISE command is
             given.

        Detached Jobs

             You cannot advise detached jobs.

   Warning


        Talking Between a VT100 and a VT52

             If links between VT100 and VT52  terminals  are  established
             using  an  ADVISE  (or  TALK) command, the VT52 may function
             improperly during or after the  linked  interval  (e.g.,  by
             requiring  frequent  CTRL/Q commands to print multiple lines
             of output).  Turning the terminal  off  and  then  on  again
             (after the linked interval) will correct this problem.


   Effect on Memory and Terminal


                                     5



        The ADVISE  command  does  not  affect  memory  and  leaves  your
        terminal  at  the advisee's terminal's command level, controlling
        his job.

   APPEND



   Adds the contents of one or more source files to the end of a  new  or
   existing  destination  file on disk, leaving the original source files
   unchanged.


   Format

        @@subcommand        @@subcommand

        where

        source filespec(s)       is a single  file  specification,  or  a
                                 series of them separated by commas

        destination filespec     is the specification of the  destination

                 PARITY
        ASCII    NOPARITY        specifies that the files being  appended

                                 words  each  consisting  of  five  7-bit
                                 bytes  and  a  parity  bit;  the  PARITY

                                 punched.

        BINARY                   specifies that the files being  appended
                                 are   composed  of  36-bit  words,  each
                                 consisting of six 6-bit bytes, with  the

                                 number).  If you do not  give  the  BYTE
                                 subcommand,  the  destination  file will
                                 have the same byte size  as  the  source
                                 file.

                PARITY
        ASCII   NOPARITY         specifies that the files being  appended
                                 are  written  in ASCII mode, with 36-bit
                                 words  each  consisting  of  five  7-bit

                                 number).  If you do not  give  the  BYTE
                                 subcommand,  the  destination  file will
                                 have the same byte size  as  the  source

   Output


        As each file is appended, the system prints its specification and
        the  word  [OK].  Also, if recognition is used on the destination
        file specification, the system prints its status (Old generation,
        New  generation, New file, or Superseding, for disk files; or OK,
        if the files are appended to a non-disk device).


                                     9



   Characteristics


        Files Appended in Order Specified

             The APPEND command attaches source files to the  destination
             file in the order you specify them; the contents of the last
             specified source will appear at the end of  the  destination
             file when APPEND is finished.


        Subcommands Optional

             For most purposes you do not need to  use  subcommands  when
             transferring  information  with  the  APPEND command.  These
             subcommands, specifying the format of  the  appended  files,
             are  required  only when using certain devices (for example,
             devices of the form MTn:  (tape drives) using labeled tapes,
             or PTR:  (paper tape reader)) or under particular conditions
             (for  example,  when   transferring   files   over   network
             facilities).   If  you  are  appending information from disk
             files  or  from  your  terminal  and  you  do  not  use  any
             subcommands,  the  data will be appended as written, whether
             in a standard format (usually ASCII or binary) or not.


   Special Cases


        Wildcard Characters

             Wildcard characters (* and %) can be  used  in  source  file
             specifications   only.   The  files  are  then  appended  in
             alphabetical order.

        Appending Information from your Terminal

             If you type TTY:  in place of  source  file  specifications,
             the  system  appends  any  characters  you  then type (after
             completing the command itself), until you give a  CTRL/Z  to
             return  your  terminal  to  TOPS-20  command level.  CTRL/U,
             CTRL/R, CTRL/W, and the Delete key can be used to  edit  the
             current line of terminal input.


   Restrictions


        Source Files With Differing Formats

             You can use the APPEND  command  to  transfer  data  from  a
             magnetic  tape, terminal, card reader, paper tape reader, or


                                     10



             other device to disk files, but if source files  written  in
             differing  formats  are  specified  within the same command,
             some data can be lost in the transfer.

        Mixing Sequenced and Unsequenced Files

             Source files created by the EDIT program should not  contain
             sequence  numbers when they are appended.  Mixing files that
             contain sequence numbers with files that do not  will  cause
             EDIT to function improperly if used on the resulting file.


        Appending to Archived Files

             You can append the contents of an archived file  to  another
             file,  by specifying it as the first (or source) argument of
             an APPEND command.  You can then edit  the  resulting  file,
             because it does not gain archive status although part of its
             contents are the same as those of  the  archived  file;  the
             archived  file  remains unchanged.  However, you cannot give
             the specification of an archived  file  as  the  second  (or
             destination)  argument  of  an APPEND command, as this would
             change the file's contents.


   Effect on Memory and Terminal


        The APPEND command  does  not  affect  memory,  and  leaves  your
        terminal at TOPS-20 command level.


   Related Commands


        COPY     for making copies of files


   Examples


        1.  Use the APPEND command to join two files.

            @APPEND FORT.FOR FIL.FOR
             FORT.FOR.8 [OK]
            @

        2.  Append two files to the end of a third file.

            @APPEND FORT.FOR, GORT.FOR GIL.FOR
             FORT.FOR.8 [OK]
             GORT.FOR.6 [OK]

            @

        3.  Access a directory and append a file from it  to  a  file  in
            your connected directory.

            @ACCESS <MANUALS>
            Password:
            @APPEND <MANUALS>REL3A.MEM REL3A.MEM
             <MANUALS>REL3A.MEM.4 [OK]
            @END-ACCESS <MANUALS>
            @

        4.  Use a wildcard character (%) to append several files  to  the
            end of another file.

            @APPEND %ORT.FOR HIL.FOR
             FORT.FOR.8 [OK]
             GORT.FOR.6 [OK]
             HORT.FOR.3 [OK]
             MORT.FOR.2 [OK]
            @

        5.  Use a wildcard character with the APPEND command to create  a
            new file.

            @APPEND *.TXT BACKUP.TXT
             MAIL.TXT.1 [OK]
             NEWRUN.TXT.1 [OK]
             NX.TXT.1 [OK]
            @

        6.  Append a message from your terminal to the beginning  of  the
            file  created  in  Example  5.   Use  the symbolic generation
            number -1 to specify this action.

            @APPEND TTY:,BACKUP.TXT BACKUP.TXT.-1
             TTY:

             Whenever a file is taken  off  line  as  a  result  of  your
|            ARCHIVE  command (for example, when you do not also give the
|            RETAIN  subcommand),  the  operator  sends  a  mail  message
|            notifying  you  that  the file has been archived.  Read this
|            message with the RDMAIL or  DECmail/MS  program.   For  this
             purpose,  the  owner  of  the directory is defined to be the
             user  or  users  whose  user  names  appear  in  a  file  of


                                     13



             specification  DIRECTORY.OWNER  in  the  directory.  If this
             file does not exist, the message is sent to MAIL.TXT in  the
             directory.  If neither file exists, no message is sent.


   Characteristics


        Archived Files Unalterable

             You cannot change the contents  of  files  specified  in  an
             ARCHIVE command once the command is given, even if the files
             are not immediately copied to tape.   This  means  that  you
             cannot  alter  or  add  to  them by using the EDIT or APPEND
             command, or overwrite them  by  using  the  COPY  or  RENAME
             command.   In  general,  files  for which you have requested
             archival must not be given as the second  filespec  argument
             of these commands.

        Archived Files Invisible

             The files you  specify  in  an  ARCHIVE  command  ordinarily
             become  invisible  to  most  TOPS-20 commands as soon as the
             ARCHIVE command is  given.   However,  if  you  include  the
             RETAIN subcommand when giving the ARCHIVE command, the files
             remain visible.  See Related Commands, below, for a list  of
             commands you can use with invisible files.


   Effect on Memory and Terminal


        The ARCHIVE command  does  not  affect  memory  and  leaves  your
        terminal at TOPS-20 command level.

   ASSIGN



   Reserves a specific input-output device for your job.


   Format


        @ASSIGN          dev:        @ASSIGN (DEVICE) dev:

        where

*       dev:      is the name of the device  you  want  to  assign.   The
*                 colon after the device name is optional.


   Restrictions


        Assigning Magnetic Tape Drives

             You can use the ASSIGN command to assign tape drives only if
             they  are  of the form MTAn:.  Tape device names of the form
             MTn:  are  logical  device  names  only,  and  are  assigned
             automatically at the time of MOUNT TAPE commands.

   Characteristics


        Current Job Detached

             If you give the ATTACH command while logged in, your current
             job  is  detached.   You can use the LOGOUT n command to log
             out this detached job.


   Hint


        Using ATTACH to Restore Phoned-in Jobs

             If you log in to the system by telephone lines  and  service
             is  interrupted  for  any  reason, use the ATTACH command to
|            restore the connection.  If you do not do  this  within  the
|            time limit set by the system manager (usually five minutes),
|            your job will be logged out automatically and you will  have
             to log in again.



                                     19



   Warning


        Attaching Attached Jobs

             The system will ask  you  to  confirm  your  choice  with  a
             carriage return before attaching to your terminal a job that
             is attached elsewhere.  If you attach an attached  job  that
             is  running  a program, that program may be sent one or more
             CTRL/Cs,  which  can  affect  programs  that  handle  CTRL/C
             themselves.   To  avoid  this  possibility  you  must give a
             DETACH command from the terminal to which the program's  job
             is  attached,  then attach this job to your terminal with an
             ATTACH command.


   Effect on Memory, Terminal, and Job


        The ATTACH command affects neither memory nor the  job  that  you
        are  attaching (but see Warning, above), and leaves your terminal
        at TOPS-20 command level unless a program is  being  run  by  the
        job.  If a program is being run, your terminal is left at command
        level, if any, in the job.  Your terminal's characteristics  will
        be  those  established  in the job from which you gave the ATTACH
        command; if you were not logged in, they will be reset to  system
        default characteristics.

   BACKSPACE



   Moves a magnetic tape set backward over a specified number of files or
   records.


   Format


         BACKSPACE          dev:  n units        @BACKSPACE (DEVICE) dev:  n units

        where

        dev:      is the name of the tape set or magnetic tape drive that
*                 you  want to move backward.  The colon after the device
*                 name is optional.

        n         is the number of files or records over which  you  want
                  to backspace
                       Default                       Default n - 1

        units     is either FILES or RECORDS
                       Default                       Default units - FILES


   Restrictions


        BACKSPACE with Open Files

             If you have given a CTRL/C to exit from a program  that  has
             opened a magnetic tape drive and you then give the BACKSPACE
             command for that tape drive, the system will  first  ask  if
             you  want  to close the associated file.  You must do so for
             BACKSPACE to succeed, but you will  probably  be  unable  to
             continue  the  program from that point because the file will
             now be closed.

        RECORDS Argument Used for Unlabeled Tapes Only

             You cannot  give  the  RECORDS  argument  to  the  BACKSPACE
             command  when  using  a labeled tape, because read and write
             operations for labeled tapes always move  the  tape  to  the
             beginning of a file first.


   Effect on Memory and Terminal


        The BACKSPACE command does not  affect  memory  and  leaves  your


                                     22



        terminal at TOPS-20 command level.


   Related Commands


        SKIP       for moving a magnetic tape set forward

        REWIND     for backspacing a tape  volume  or  tape  set  to  its
                   logical beginning (the beginning of the first file)

|       UNLOAD     for completely rewinding  a  magnetic  tape  onto  the
|                  source reel


   Examples


        1.  Backspace your magnetic tape one file.

            @BACKSPACE MTA0: 1 FILE
            @

   BLANK



|  Clears your video terminal screen.  It has no effect on  a  hard  copy
   terminal.


   Format


         BLANK        @BLANK (SCREEN)
        @


   Characteristics


        This command moves the cursor to line 1 of the screen,  providing
        you  with  a  clean area for typing commands and receiving system
        output.


|  Restriction
|  
|  
|       The BLANK command functions only if you have  set  your  terminal
|       type with the TERMINAL command.
|  
|  
   Effect on Memory and Terminal


        The BLANK command does not affect memory and leaves your terminal
        at TOPS-20 command level.

   BREAK



|  Breaks the communication link established between terminals  with  the
|  TALK command.


   Format


         BREAK              argument        @BREAK (LINKS WITH) argument
        @

        where

        argument     is a user name  or  line  number.   If  you  do  not
                     specify  an  argument,  all  communication links are
                     broken.


   Restrictions


        Does Not End Advice

             The BREAK command, given at either of two  terminals  joined
|            by  the  ADVISE  command,  does  not  end advice.  To end an
|            ADVISE link, type CTRL/E.


   Effect on Memory


        The BREAK command does not affect memory and leaves your terminal
        at TOPS-20 command level.


   Related Commands

|                                superior  directory.  This working space
|                                is temporary and  is  allocated  to  the

   Characteristics


        BUILD and ^ECREATE

             The BUILD command is identical in format to  the  privileged
             ^ECREATE  command.   If you use BUILD with Wheel or Operator
             capabilities enabled, it has the  same  power  as  ^ECREATE,
             namely,  to  create directories and modify the parameters of
             any directory on the system.   Without  these  capabilities,
             you  can  use  BUILD  to  modify  a  more  restricted set of
             directories:  you can modify a directory if you  have  write
             access  to  the  immediately superior directory.  The LOGIN,
             CONNECT, or ACCESS  command  obtains  write  access  to  the
             superior  directory; or, if you have sufficient group rights
             to the superior directory, you can use BUILD to  modify  its
             subdirectories.


        More Information

             For a description of using ^ECREATE to  create  directories,
             see   the  TOPS-20  Operator's  Command  Language  Reference
             Manual.


        Quotas Subtracted from the Superior Directory's Allotments

             Working and permanent disk  storage  page  limits,  and  the
             maximum  number  of subdirectories allowed to a subdirectory
             are subtracted from the quotas allocated to the  immediately
             superior  directory.  This subtraction occurs at the time of
             their  allotment  to  a  subdirectory.   If   the   superior
             directory's  quota is not sufficient, the BUILD command will
|            fail.  (Note that if you  have  enabled  Wheel  or  Operator
|            capabilities you can stop the subtraction of quotas from the
|            superior directory with the PRESERVE subcommand.)

             To increase the superior directory's quota or any  of  these
             quantities  you  must either kill some of its subdirectories
             or reduce their allotments of the quantity.  Or you can  ask
             the system manager to increase the allotment of the superior
             directory.  Remember that unless  you  specify  working  and


                                     36



             permanent  page  limits, they will assume a default value of
             250 pages.  The BUILD command will  fail  in  this  case  if
             there  are  not  at  least 250 pages free in the immediately
             superior directory.


        Assigning Infinite Quotas

             If you have Wheel or Operator capabilities enabled, you  can
             assign  the  maximum  storage  limit  of  34359738367 (i.e.,
             2**35-1) to a directory.  This will appear in  the  response
             to  an  INFORMATION  DIRECTORY  command  as  +INF,  denoting
             infinite storage  capacity.   If  you  then  use  the  BUILD
             command  to  construct subdirectories to this directory, any
             disk storage capacity assigned, even the maximum,  will  not
             be subtracted from the superior directory.  You can use this
             feature to assign infinite storage capacity to a  number  of
             users sharing a private structure.  Then these users may use
             storage space on the structure without limit until the  disk
             pack fills up.


   Hints


        Keeping Track of Subdirectories

             Subdirectories appear as files of  type  .DIRECTORY  in  the
             immediately superior directory, so the DIRECTORY *.DIRECTORY
             command  for  the  superior  directory  will  indicate   any
             existing  subdirectories.   To suppress the listing of these
             files you can use the SET FILE PROTECTION  command  to  give
             them  a  protection of 000000, but then you must specify the
             files completely (including  generation  number)  to  access
             them in the future.

             If there are two or more levels of  subdirectories  below  a
             superior  directory,  you  can  do something else to allow a
             listing of them:  put each  subdirectory  into  a  group  of
             which the owner of the highest-level superior directory is a
             member.  Then, if you obtain the group rights of this  owner
             (e.g.,  by using the LOGIN or ACCESS command if the superior
             directory is on the public structure, or ACCESS if it is  on
             another  structure), the INFORMATION DIRECTORY <directory.*>
             command with the NAME-ONLY subcommand will produce a listing
             of  subdirectories  at  every  level  beneath  the  superior
             directory.  For this feature to operate properly  the  group
             field  of  each  subdirectory's  protection  code must be at
             least 40.

        Modifying Subdirectories Easily



                                     37



             By  following  the  above  procedure,  that  is,  by  making
             subdirectories at every level members of groups of which the
             owner of the highest-level  superior  directory  is  also  a
             member,  you  make  the modification of these subdirectories
             much easier.  You can use the BUILD command to modify  these
             subdirectories  or  read  and  write to them, as long as you
             have the group memberships of  this  owner.   You  need  not
             connect  to  each  subdirectory's immediate superior to make
             modifications.


   Restrictions


        Giving Capabilities to Subdirectory Owners

             In   order   to   give   capabilities   (Wheel,    Operator,
             Absolute-Arpanet-Sockets,    Arpanet-Wizard,   Confidential,
             Enq-Deq, IPCF, or Maintenance) to a subdirectory owner,  you
             must  have  these  capabilities  yourself,  and they must be
             enabled at  the  time  of  the  BUILD  command.   Wheel  and
             Operator  capabilities allow you to assign any capabilities.
             The INFORMATION DIRECTORY command for your log-in  directory
             tells you which capabilities you have, if any.

        Modifying Other Directories

             Unless you have Wheel or Operator capabilities enabled,  you
             can  use  the BUILD command to modify the parameters of only
             those directories subordinate to a directory  to  which  you
             have   write   access.    (See  Characteristics - BUILD  and
             ^ECREATE,  and  Hints - Modifying   Subdirectories   Easily,
             above.)  If your installation allows it, you can use the SET
             DIRECTORY  command  to  change  some  parameters  of   these
             directories.

        Files-only Directories

             By giving the FILES-ONLY subcommand you make the directory a
             files-only directory (see Figure 1).  A files-only directory
             is not associated with a user and so  should  not  be  given
             capabilities   or   user   group  memberships.   Although  a
             files-only directory can have subdirectories, none of  these
             can  be  a  user  directory.   You cannot give the ACCESS or
             LOGIN command for a files-only directory.

        Killing Directories

             You cannot kill a directory that has  subdirectories;  first
             you  must  kill  those subdirectories one by one.  (When you

   Output


        When you complete a CANCEL command removing a request, the system
        responds  with  "[1  Job  Canceled]"  and  makes  the appropriate
        deletion  from  the  indicated  queue.   If  the  job  is   being
        processed,   the   response   is  "[1  Job  Canceled  (1  was  in
        progress)]", but if the job is already  finished,  it  is  simply
        "[No Jobs Killed]".


   Characteristics


        Request ID or Jobname as Argument to CANCEL

             You can cancel a  single  queue  request  (those  made  with
             Queue-class  commands - MOUNT, PLOT, PRINT, PUNCH, RETRIEVE,
             or SUBMIT) by giving either its request  ID  number  or  its
             jobname  as  the  second argument of a CANCEL command.  This
             argument is interpreted as a request  ID  number  unless  it
             includes   one  or  more  non-numeric  characters.   If  the
             argument includes non-numeric characters it  is  interpreted
             as a jobname.  By giving a jobname as the second argument of
             a CANCEL command, you  cancel  all  your  requests  of  that
             jobname  in  the  specified  queue.   But  see  also Special
             Cases -  /JOBNAME Switch, below.


   Special Cases


        /SPOOLED-OUTPUT Switch

             You can give the special switch, /SPOOLED-OUTPUT, after  the


                                     45



             CARDS,  PAPER-TAPE,  PLOT,  or  PRINT argument to the CANCEL
             command.  By doing so you cause any accumulated requests  in
             the  spooler  queue for the appropriate output device (CDP:,
             PTP:, PLT:, or LPT:, respectively) to  be  canceled,  rather
             than  filled  when  you  log  out.   Do not give any further
             arguments to a "CANCEL queue /SPOOLED-OUTPUT" command.

        /JOBNAME Switch

             In the singular case when you want to cancel  several  queue
             requests  of  the  same  jobname using a single command, and
             that jobname is purely numerical (for  example,  5045),  you
             must  use the /JOBNAME:jobname switch as the second argument
             to the CANCEL command.  Do not also give the request  ID  or
             jobname   as   a   command   argument   if   you   give  the
             /JOBNAME:jobname switch.


   Restrictions


        Cannot Cancel Filled Tape-mount Requests

             You cannot use the CANCEL command to withdraw a  MOUNT  TAPE
             request  once  the  first  volume  of  tape has been mounted
             (i.e., once  you  have  received  a  message  of  the  form,
             [setname  defined  as  MTn:]).   Use the DISMOUNT command to
             give up your tape resource in  this  case.   Note  that  the
             DEASSIGN or LOGOUT command will also dismount the tape set.

        Cannot Cancel Certain Archival Requests

             You cannot use the CANCEL command to  withdraw  an  archival
             request once the operator has initiated archival procedures.
             Thus,  even  though  files  remain  on  disk   between   the
             operator's  first and second archive runs, you cannot cancel
             a request during this time.  If you try to cancel a  request
             after archiving has begun, you receive the error message:

                  ?File has archive status:  filename

             Note that this error does not terminate a  multifile  CANCEL
             ARCHIVE  command  (for  example,  CANCEL  ARCHIVE  *.*); the
             TOPS-20  command   processor   continues   processing   each
             remaining  filename  in  the  request.   Cancel requests for
             these remaining files are judged individually.


   Effect on Memory and Terminal


             The CANCEL command does not affect memory  and  leaves  your


                                     46



             terminal at TOPS-20 command level.

   CLOSE



   Closes files in your job and releases their JFNs.


   Format


         CLOSE       n        @CLOSE (JFN) n

        where

        n         is the JFN (Job File Number) of a file
                       Default                       Default n - all JFNs for open and closed files


   Output


        When the CLOSE command is completed, the system prints a  message
        on  your terminal for each JFN that it has closed or attempted to
        close.


   Characteristics


        CLOSE Usually Unnecessary

             The CLOSE command is used to preserve the contents of a file
             after  the  abnormal  termination of the program that opened
             it.  Under ordinary conditions you do not need  to  use  the
             CLOSE command.


   Special Cases


        CLOSE For Closed Files

             If you give the CLOSE command for  an  existing  but  closed
             JFN, the JFN is released.


   Restrictions


        Closing Mapped Files

             You cannot close files that are mapped into memory; in  this


                                     50



             case  you  may  give the RESET command, which clears memory.
             (Note, however, that RESET will delete and expunge a  mapped
             file if the file is new, rather than save it as CLOSE would.
             To save a new mapped file, give the  SET  PAGE-ACCESS  0:777
             NONEXISTENT  command, and follow this with CLOSE.)  If RESET
             by itself does not close the file, you  may  first  have  to
             give  the  POP  command  to  return to a higher level of the
             TOPS-20 command processor; then give the RESET command.

        Once memory has been cleared, all files are closed for  processes
        at the current and lower levels of TOPS-20.


   Effect on Memory and Terminal


        The CLOSE command does not affect memory and leaves your terminal
        at TOPS-20 command level.

   Examples

        2.  Try to close all your open files.  Give the RESET command  to
            close  those  that are mapped.  (Note that the file EXEC.EXE,
            containing the TOPS-20 command processor, cannot be closed.)

   COMPILE



   Translates source files into object (relocatable binary) files.


   Format


         COMPILE        /switch(es) source/switch(es) object,...        @COMPILE (FROM) /switch(es) source/switch(es) object,...

        where

        switches       are  keywords  chosen   from   the   list   below,
                       indicating your choice of COMPILE command options.
                       They have different  effects  depending  on  their
                       position  in  the command line:  placed before all
                       files in the command, they  act  as  defaults  for
                       all;  otherwise,  they  affect  only  the  nearest
                       preceding file.
                            Defaults                            Defaults are shown in the list of switches

        source         is the file specification  of  a  source  program.
                       The filename must be of 6 or fewer characters, and
                       the file type of 3 or fewer characters; you cannot
                       use a generation number.
                            Default                            Default - arguments you  gave  in  your  last
                                      LOAD-class command

        object         is the filename you choose for the object file; it
                       must be of 6 or fewer characters.
                            Default                            Default - filename of the source  file  (file
                                      type is .REL)

        ,...           means  that,  after  commas,  you  can  give  more

                            Default|                           Default for files of type .ALG

        /BINARY        allows generation of an object (binary)  file  for
                       each source file given.  Use this switch to cancel
                       a /NOBINARY switch.
                            Default                            Default

|       /COBOL         compiles the file using the COBOL compiler, either
|                      COBOL-68  or  COBOL-74, that your installation has
|                      stored in the file SYS:COBOL.EXE.
                            Default|                           Default for files of type .CBL

        /COMPILE       forces compilation of the source file  even  if  a
                       current  object  file  already  exists.   Use this
                       switch along with the /LIST  or  /CREF  switch  to
                       obtain  listings  when  you  have  current  object
                       files.  (See also the /NOBINARY switch.)

        /CREF          same as /CROSS-REFERENCE

|       /CROSS-REFERENCE
                       creates   a   file   containing    cross-reference
                       information for each compilation.  The filename is
                       that of the object file; the file  type  is  .CRF.
                       Use  the  CREF  command to obtain a listing of the
                       file.  (For COBOL files, this switch automatically
                       produces  a  cross-reference  listing.)   See  the
                       _______ ____ _________ _____                       TOPS-20 User Utilities Guide for information about
                       the CREF program.

        /DEBUG         produces  an  object  file  containing   debugging
                       information beyond what is usually inserted during
                       a compilation.  (For FORTRAN  programs  only,  and
                       only if you have not given the /OPTIMIZE switch.)

|       /FAIL          compiles the file using the FAIL compiler.
                            Default|                           Default for files of type .FAI
|  
|       /FLAG-NON-STANDARD
                       indicates non-standard syntax in file.

        /FORTRAN       compiles the file using the FORTRAN compiler
                            Default                            Default  for  switches  specifying   compiler
                                     language,   in   the  absence  of  a
                                     standard source file type
                            Default|                           Default  for files of type .FOR

        /LANGUAGE-SWITCHES:"/switch(es)"
                       passes the specified switches to the compiler that
                       will  process  the  file(s)  to  which this switch
                       applies.  You must include the switches in  double
                       quotation marks ("  ").

        /LIST          prints a listing of the program in  ASCII  format;
                       the  name  of  this listing is the filename of the
                       object file.  The  /CREF  switch  overrides  /LIST
                       when they both apply to the same file.

        /NOBINARY      prevents generation of an  object  (binary)  file.
                       Use this switch along with /LIST or /CREF to allow
                       these switches to take effect without producing  a
                       new object file.

        /NOCOMPILE     prevents compilation if the associated object file
                       is   current;  otherwise  it  forces  compilation.

|       /NOWARNINGS    prevents display of warnings for nonfatal errors.

        /OPTIMIZE      calls  for  generation  of  a  globally  optimized
                       object  file, that is, one that runs as quickly as
                       possible.  (For FORTRAN programs only, and only if

   Characteristics


        Compiling New Sources Only

             The system usually compiles only  those  sources  for  which
             there  are  no  current object files, that is, sources whose


                                     57



             write dates are more recent than those of the  object  files
             of the same name.


|       Default Switches Not Passed to Compiler
|  
|            Only switches specified in a LOAD-class command  are  passed
|            to  the compiler; default switches are not passed.  Instead,
|            the system assumes that the defaults for  the  compiler  are
|            the same as the defaults for the LOAD-class command.

             However, sources for which you supply a new object  filename
             are  compiled  even  if there are current object files.  You
             can always force compilation with the /COMPILE switch.


        Using Standard File Types

             If you specify source files with standard types (.FOR, .MAC,
             .CBL,   or   .ALG)   in   a   COMPILE  command,  the  system
             automatically   calls   the   appropriate   compiler    when
             compilation  is  necessary.   If you specify source files by
             filename only, the system searches your connected  directory
             in  the  above  order for a file of this name and a standard
             type.   To  compile  programs   from   sources   that   have
             nonstandard file types, give a switch to indicate the proper
             compiler (/FORTRAN, /MACRO, /COBOL, or  /ALGOL).   A  switch
             will  take  precedence  over  a  standard  file type if they
             indicate different languages.  If no compiler  is  indicated
             with  either  a  switch or a standard file type, the FORTRAN
             compiler is used.


   Hints


        Plus Signs Between Filespecs

             If you give two or more filespecs separated  by  plus  signs
             (+)  as  arguments to COMPILE, they are compiled together as
             if they were a single file.  Their object module  is  stored
             under  any  filename  given  as the "object" argument of the
             command, or (if none) under the last filename in  the  group
             and file type .REL.

        Indirect Files as Arguments

             You can store the arguments (source  and  object  filespecs,
             switches)  of  a  COMPILE  command  in an indirect file, and
             specify them by typing an at sign (@) and its filespec as  a
             COMPILE command argument.



                                     58



        Establishing Default Arguments with the SET Command

             You can issue the SET DEFAULT  COMPILE-SWITCHES  command  to
             set  up  default  global  arguments  to the COMPILE command.
             Insert this SET command in your COMAND.CMD  file  to  change
             your own defaults permanently.


   Restrictions


        Switches Assuming Compilation

             /CREF
             /DEBUG
             /LANGUAGE-SWITCHES
             /LIST
             /NODEBUG
             /NOLIST
             /NOOPTIMIZE
             /OPTIMIZE

             The above switches will not take effect unless  the  COMPILE
             command  causes  a  new  compilation  of the relevant source
             file.  See  Characteristics - Compiling  New  Sources  Only,
             above, for more information.

|       Wildcards Illegal with COMPILE
|  
|            The COMPILE command does not accept wildcard  characters  (*
|            and %) in a file specification.


   Effect on Memory and Terminal


        The COMPILE command  clears  memory  and  loads  the  appropriate
        compiler.  After the compilation your terminal is left at TOPS-20
        command level.

   CONNECT



|  Connects your job to a directory.


   Format


         CONNECT                dev:<directory>        @CONNECT (TO DIRECTORY) dev:<directory>
                   password        PASSWORD:  password
        @

        where

        dev:<directory>     is the directory to which you want to connect
                                 Default                                 Default dev: - your connected structure

                                 Default                                 Default <directory> - the directory  (on
                                         the  specified structure) of the
                                         same  name  as  your   connected
                                         directory

                                 Default                                 Default (if no arguments  are  given)  -
                                         your  log-in  directory  on  the
                                         public structure

        password            is  the  password  of  the   directory   (not
                            requested  for  your  log-in  directory  or a
                            directory to which you already have ownership
                            or sufficient group rights)


   Characteristics


        Capabilities

             Your capabilities (Wheel, Operator, Confidential, etc.)  are
             associated  with your log-in user name only.  If you connect
             to a directory whose owner has Wheel  capabilities,  you  do
             not gain these capabilities.


   Hints


        Obtaining Group Rights

             You can obtain group rights equal to those of the owner of a
             directory  by  giving  the  ACCESS command instead of, or in


                                     62



             addition to, CONNECT for that directory.


   Restrictions


        Features Not Affected

             For some  system  features,  CONNECT  does  not  affect  the
             directory used:

        System Accounting

             The SET ACCOUNT command  allows  arguments  valid  for  your
             log-in  user  name  only.  Generally, charges for system use
             are made to your log-in user name.

        Queue-class Commands

             The Queue-class commands charge processing requests to  your
             log-in user name only.


   Effect on Memory and Terminal


        The CONNECT command  does  not  affect  memory  and  leaves  your
        terminal at TOPS-20 command level.


   Related Commands


        ACCESS     for obtaining group as well as ownership rights  equal
                   to those of the owner of a directory

        MOUNT      for making a structure available  for  connecting  and
                   ensuring the continued availability of the structure


   Examples


        1.  Connect to another user's directory.

                 @CONNECT <HOLLAND>
                 Password:
                 @

        2.  Try  to  access  a  directory.   Discovering  that  it  is  a
            files-only directory, connect to it instead.



                                     63

                 Password:
                 @

        3.  Connect to another  user's  directory  on  a  different  file
            structure  and then to your directory on that structure; then
            return to your log-in directory  on  PS:.   Give  INFORMATION
            JOB-STATUS  commands  as  you go along to check which is your
            connected directory.

            @INFORMATION JOB

        4.  Connect to your directory on  another  structure  and  obtain
            your   full  rights  to  it.   After  giving  an  INFORMATION
            JOB-STATUS command to verify your connected directory, give a
            command  that  depends  on these rights.  Then return to your

   CONTINUE



   Resumes execution of a specified fork that is halted.


   Format


         CONTINUE        argument /switch|       @CONTINUE (FORK) argument /switch

        where

|       argument       is the fork name or octal fork number
                            Default|                           Default - the current fork
|  
|       /switch        is  a  keyword,  chosen  from  the   list   below,

|  
|  
|                        CONTINUE Command Switches
|  
|  
|       /BACKGROUND    keeps your terminal at TOPS-20 command  level  and
|                      continues   execution   of   the   program   in  a
|                      "background"  fork.   When  the  program  requires
|                      terminal input, it is halted and the system prints
|                      the message, [FORK-NAME wants the TTY].
|  
|       /NORMALLY      restores your terminal to command level  (if  any)

|  
|       /STAY          keeps your terminal at TOPS-20 command  level  and
|                      continues   execution   of   the   program   in  a
|                      "background"  fork.   When  the  program  requires
|                      terminal  input,  the  program  halts  and accepts
|                      terminal input.
|  
|  
|  Characteristics
|  
|  
|       Continuing a NonCurrent Fork
|  
|            When you  continue  a  noncurrent  fork,  by  including  the
|            fork-name argument in a CONTINUE command, the specified fork
|            becomes your current fork.

|  Hints
|  
|  
|       Stopping a Background Program
|  
|            You can stop a program that is running in a background  fork
|            while  your  terminal is at EXEC command level or at program
|            level.  To stop a background program while your terminal  is
|            at  EXEC  command level, give the FREEZE command.  To stop a
|            background program  from  program  level,  first  return  to
|            program command level with CONTINUE /NORMALLY, then type two
|            CTRL/Cs to halt the program and return your terminal to EXEC
|            command  level.   Note that the first CTRL/C does not appear
|            on the terminal.
|  
|       Providing Input to a Background Program
|  
|            A background program, continued with  CONTINUE  /BACKGROUND,
|            sends  the  message  [FORK-NAME wants the TTY] when it wants
|            input.  A background program, continued with CONTINUE  /STAY
|            prints  the  program  prompt,  for  example PASCAL>, when it
|            wants input.
|  
|            To  provide  input  to  a  program  that  is  running  in  a
|            background  fork,  return  to  program  command  level  with
|            CONTINUE /NORMALLY.  (Some programs require you to  type  an
|            extra RETURN after CONTINUE /NORMALLY to display the program
|            prompt).  Then,  type  the  required  program  input.   (See
|            below, Restrictions, Programs Competing for Terminal Input).

        Monitoring your Program

|            CONTINUE /STAY and CONTINUE  /BACKGROUND,  by  keeping  your
|            terminal  at  TOPS-20  command  level  (EXEC),  let  you use
|            TOPS-20 commands to monitor the  progress  of  your  program
|            while  it  is  running.   Use  the  INFORMATION  FORK-STATUS
|            command to display the CPU time used and the  kept  and  RUN
|            status  of  each  fork  belonging to the current EXEC level.
|            More commands for monitoring your programs are listed  below
|            in Related Commands.
|  
|       Running Multiple Programs Simultaneously
|  
|            To simultaneously run multiple programs in background  forks
|            or   use   commands  that  affect  memory,  use  one,  or  a
|            combination, of the following methods after typing  CONTINUE
|            /STAY or CONTINUE /BACKGROUND:
|  
|            PUSHing to a New EXEC Level
|  
|                 Type the PUSH command to create a new EXEC level and  a
|                 fresh copy of memory (address space).  Then run another


                                     67



|                 program and return to EXEC command level with  CONTINUE
|                 /STAY  or  CONTINUE  /BACKGROUND.  The new program does
|                 not affect the background program since  both  programs
|                 are   at   a   different   EXEC  level.   However,  see
|                 Restrictions below.  PUSH to a new EXEC before  running
|                 each new program.
|  
|            KEEPing the Fork
|  
|                 Type the KEEP command to give  the  background  fork  a
|                 "kept" status.  (A kept fork is not cleared from memory
|                 when another  program  is  loaded.)  Then  run  another
|                 program  and return to EXEC command level with CONTINUE
|                 /STAY or CONTINUE /BACKGROUND.   KEEP  each  background
|                 fork  before running another program.  Check the status
|                 of your forks with INFORMATION FORK-STATUS.
|  
|  
|       Continuing Forks Using the Fork Name
|  
|            You can continue a fork by typing the fork  name  as  if  it
|            were  the  CONTINUE  command.   To  function as the CONTINUE
|            command, the fork must be "kept" with the KEEP  or  the  SET
|            PROGRAM  KEEP  command.   For more information, refer to the
|            descriptions of these commands.
|  
|       More Information
|  
|            The   CONTINUE   command   is    one    of    the    TOPS-20
|            multiforking-class  commands.   For  more  information about
|            multiforking,  see  the  section  named   Running   Multiple
                             _______ ______ _____|            Programs in the TOPS-20 User's Guide.


   Restrictions


        Similar Programs Competing for Files

             If you have two similar programs running at once after using
|            CONTINUE  /STAY,  or CONTINUE /BACKGROUND, and PUSH commands
             (see Hints, above), they may try to access the same files at
|            the  same  time (for example, temporary files labeled by job
             number, used by compilers).

             This may cause  unpredictable  situations  to  develop.   To
             avoid  the  possibility,  run  different kinds of program or
|            give different kinds of command (for example,  a  LOAD-class
             command  and  an EDIT-class command) at the different levels
             in your job.

        Programs Competing for Terminal Input


                                     68



|            If you use CONTINUE /STAY to run a program in  a  background
|            fork,  either  at  the  current  or  at a lower EXEC command
|            level, (see Hints - Using PUSH to Get a New TOPS-20  Command
|            Level,  above),  the  program  can  request  input  from the
|            terminal while you are giving input to the EXEC  or  another
|            program.   This  input  can  be  randomly intercepted by the
|            background program when it requests terminal input.
|  
|            When  terminal  input  is  intercepted  by  the   background
|            program, the program will usually type input error messages.
|            To give input to the program, stop the program by typing two
|            CTRL/Cs  or  the  program's  exit  command.   Then,  if  the
|            background program is at a higher EXEC command  level,  give
|            POP  commands  to  return  to  the EXEC level that holds the
|            background program.  (POP terminates the  current  EXEC  and
|            erases  programs  in its memory.) Finally, give the CONTINUE
|            /NORMALLY command; this puts you at program command level so
|            that you can give the requested input.
|  
|            Remember, input is intercepted  by  the  background  program
|            randomly.   Therefore  you  may  have to type extra CTRL/Cs,
|            program exit commands, and POPs.  To reduce confusion  about
|            the  direction of terminal input, it is recommended that you
|            use CONTINUE /STAY only when you plan to work at the current
|            EXEC  level  while a program runs in a background fork.  You
|            should also CONTINUE /STAY programs that simply end  without
|            requesting  terminal  input.   Use CONTINUE /BACKGROUND when
|            you plan to work at a lower EXEC level or at another program
|            command level.
|  
|            When a program started with  CONTINUE  /BACKGROUND  requests
|            terminal  input,  it sends the message, [FORK-NAME wants the
|            TTY].  No input is taken by the background program until you
|            return  to  program  command  level with CONTINUE /NORMALLY.
|            You  should  CONTINUE /BACKGROUND  programs   that   request
|            terminal input.

        Commands That Affect Context of Job

             Certain commands, by altering the context of your  job,  can
             affect  programs  you  are  running without changing memory.
             ACCESS,  CONNECT,  and  DEFINE  are  examples.   Give  these
|            commands with caution after CONTINUE /BACKGROUND or CONTINUE
|            /STAY, even if the background forks are  kept  or  you  have
             given a PUSH command.


   Effect on Memory and Terminal


|       The CONTINUE /NORMALLY command does not  affect  memory,  resumes
        processing  the  program  in  memory, and leaves your terminal at


                                     69



|       program  command  level  (if  there  is   one).    The   CONTINUE
|       /BACKGROUND and CONTINUE /STAY commands also do not affect memory
|       and resume processing the  program  in  memory,  but  leave  your
|       terminal at TOPS-20 command level.

|       2.  Run the DSR program and then halt the program by  typing  two
|           CTRL/Cs.   Give  the CONTINUE /BACKGROUND command to continue
|           DSR in a background fork and return to  EXEC  command  level.
|           Then,  give  the  KEEP  command  so that you can load another
|           program without clearing the running, background,  DSR  fork.
|           Check  the  status  of  DSR  with the INFORMATION FORK-STATUS
|           command.

|           the  edit  program.   Then  check  the  fork  status with the
|           INFORMATION FORK-STATUS command.  Notice that  DSR  is  in  a

   Output




                                     75



        As each file is copied, the system prints the  specifications  of
        the  source  and  destination files and the word [OK].  The delay
        before you see this [OK] indicates how long it took to  copy  the
        file.    If   you   use   recognition  on  the  destination  file
        specification, the system prints, !New Generation!,  !New  File!,
        or  !Superseding!, to indicate the status of disk files, or !OK!,
        if the file is copied to a non-disk device.


   Characteristics


        Normal Operation - No Subcommands

             For most purposes you do not need subcommands  when  copying
             files.   When  you do not use subcommands the information is
             copied as written, whether in  a  standard  format  (usually
             ASCII or BINARY) or not.

        Optional Subcommands With Paper Tape

             Each subcommand, when used  to  copy  information  from  the
             paper  tape  reader  (PTR:),  specifies an interpretation of
             eight-bit bytes, represented as eight-hole  lines  on  paper
             tape.   When  used  with  the  paper tape punch (PTP:), each
             subcommand  specifies  a  mapping  of  information  to   the
             eight-bit bytes of paper tape.

        Optional Subcommands With Other Devices

             Each subcommand can be used under particular conditions, for
             example,  when  transferring  files  over network facilities
             (using  DCN:   and  SRV:),  to  specify  the  byte  size  of
             information  being  copied.   In  general,  you can use COPY
             command subcommands whenever you need to  specify  the  byte
             size of information being copied.


   Hints


        RENAME Faster Than COPY for Transferring Files

             For moving a set of files from one directory to  another  on
             the  same structure, the RENAME command is a faster and more
|            efficient means than COPY.   This  is  because  RENAME  only
|            changes  the  file  specifications;  it  does  not  copy the
|            contents of the files.   Also,  a  file  transfer  with  the
|            RENAME  command  leaves  only  one  set  of  files,  while a
|            transfer  with  the  COPY  command  leaves  two  sets:   the
|            original  copies  and  the destination copies.  The original
|            copies are often unnecessary and must be DELETed.


                                     76



        Using Devices as Source and/or Destination Filespecs

             By specifying a device  as  the  source  and/or  destination
             filespec,   you   can  use  the  COPY  command  to  transfer
             information between card-  or  paper-tape-handling  devices,
             magnetic  tape  drives,  line  printers, terminals, or other
             output devices.  However, the PLOT, PRINT,  PUNCH  and  TYPE
             commands, and appropriate utility programs (e.g., DUMPER and
             EDIT), offer more flexibility for most applications.

             Copying To or From TTY:

                  You can simulate the action of the CREATE  command  for
                  creating  files  by  copying from device TTY:  to a new
                  filespec, ending your input with a CTRL/Z; use  CTRL/U,
                  CTRL/R,  CTRL/W, and the DELETE key to edit the current
                  line of terminal input.  You can simulate the action of
                  the  TYPE  command for displaying files by copying from
                  an existing filespec to device TTY:.

             Viewing Display Screen Data

                  If you specify TTY:  as the  destination  filespec  and
                  then  give  the  BYTE  8  subcommand, characters in the
                  source file will be sent literally  to  your  terminal.
                  Do this to examine special display screen data.

|            Erasing the Contents of a File While Keepinig the Filespec
|  
|                 You can erase the contents of a file  by  copying  from
|                 device  NUL:   to  the file.  NUL:  is a receptacle for
|                 unwanted program output and a supplier of null input.

             Spooled Output Action

                  If you send information to  output  devices  using  the
                  COPY  command,  your  request is processed according to
                  the  status  of  the  SPOOLED-OUTPUT-ACTION  parameter,
                  which   you  set  with  the  SET  SPOOLED-OUTPUT-ACTION
                  command.

             Using Wildcards in Source and/or Destination Filespecs

                  You can use wildcard characters (*  and  %)  in  source
                  and/or  destination  filespecs  to copy many files at a
                  time.  Default values  will  be  assumed  for  filespec
                  fields  you  do  not  specify.   Note  that  if you use
                  wildcard characters to copy more than one  source  file
                  into a single destination file on disk, the contents of
                  each source file will appear in a different  generation
                  of  the  destination  file; the highest generation will
                  contain a copy of the last source file only.   Use  the

                  APPEND  command  to  put  the contents of several files
                  into a single file.

             Specifying a New Account or Protection Number

                  The COPY  command  lets  you  specify  the  new  file's
                  protection  number,  and  the  account to which storage
                  fees for it will  be  charged.   Follow  the  new  file
                  specification  with  a  semicolon  (;) and the letter P
                  before giving a new 6-digit protection number, and with
                  a  semicolon  and  the  letter  A  before  giving a new
                  account (which must be valid for your user  name).   If
                  you  do  not specify an account for a new file, it will
                  take as a default the account you  gave  in  your  most
                  recent   LOGIN   or   SET  ACCOUNT  command.   However,
                  non-default protection numbers will be  maintained  for
                  higher   generations  of  existing  files,  unless  you
                  specify otherwise in the COPY command that creates that
                  higher generation.


   Restrictions


        Copying Archived Files

|            You can make a copy of an archived file by specifying it  as
             the  first  (or  source)  argument  in  a  COPY command, and
             specifying a file of different name or type as  destination.
             You  can edit the new file, because it does not have archive
             status although it has the same  contents  as  the  original
             file.   However,  you  cannot  give  the specification of an
             archived file as the second (or destination) argument  of  a
             COPY command, as this would replace the file's contents.  If
             you attempt to do so, whatever source  argument  you  supply
             will  be  copied  into  the  next  higher  generation of the
|            archived file, leaving the archived file  intact.   And,  if
|            you   include  the  generation  number  when  specifying  an
             archived file as the second argument of a COPY command,  the
             command will fail.

        Files of Type .DIRECTORY

             You cannot copy subdirectories, which  appear  as  files  of
             type .DIRECTORY in the immediately superior directory.


   Warning


        Destroying the Previous Contents of Files



                                     78



             If you give a destination file specification that includes a
             generation  number, the source file will be copied into that
             file, replacing any previous contents if that generation  of
             the   file   already   exists.   Those  contents  cannot  be
             recovered.  But see Restrictions - Copying  Archived  Files,
             above.


   Effect on Memory and Terminal


        The COPY command does not affect memory and leaves your  terminal
        at TOPS-20 command level.

        /UNSEQUENCE      tells the EDIT program to strip the line numbers
                         from the file when the EDIT session ends

        /UPPER           specifies that  all  alphabetic  characters  you
                         type  should be considered uppercase characters;
                         give  lowercase  characters  by  preceding   the
                         corresponding  uppercase character with a single
                         quotation mark (').

        /WINDOW:n        specifies the number n (between 10  and  99)  of
                         pages  to  be  held  in  memory  during the EDIT
                         session

   Characteristics


        Input Mode and Edit Mode

             The CREATE command runs the EDIT system  program,  first  in
             Input  mode  and  then  in  Edit  mode.   (However, see also
             Special Cases, below.) Input mode automatically begins  each
             line with a line number (unless you have given the /NONUMBER
             switch), and allows you to put  any  alphabetic  or  numeric
             information  into  the  file.   When you have finished doing
             this and press the ESCAPE key, the  EDIT  program  puts  you
             into Edit mode and prompts you with an asterisk (*), just as
             if you had typed the EDIT command with the specifications of
             the newly-created file as argument.  If you want to save the
             file in its present state, give the E (for end)  command  to
             the  EDIT  program.   Otherwise  you can give any other EDIT
             command to change or add to the file before saving it.

        Saving Backup Files Periodically

             Give the /ISAVE:n switch to save an updated copy of the file
             you  are  creating  after  every n lines inserted.  Then you
             will lose only a few lines of input in the event of a system
             failure.   The  similar  /SAVE:n  switch  is  useful for the
             CREATE command only in Edit mode, where it saves an  updated
             copy  of  the  file after every n EDIT program commands that
             modify the file.

        SWITCH.INI File

             If there is a group of  CREATE  command  switches  that  you
             always  or  often use with CREATE or EDIT commands, put them
             into a file  of  specification  SWITCH.INI  in  your  log-in
             directory,  in  a line of that file beginning with EDIT:abc,
             where abc is any set of characters you  choose  to  identify
             the line.  Then if you include the single switch /OPTION:abc
             when you give a CREATE or EDIT command, all  these  switches
             will be in effect.

        Further Information

                                                                  _______             For more information about the EDIT program, see the TOPS-20

   Special Cases


        Using an Editor Other than EDIT

|            The CREATE, EDIT, and PERUSE command  descriptions  in  this
             manual  assume  that these commands call on the EDIT program
|            for their action.  If your job uses another editing program,
|            for  example  EDT, the switches and examples shown here will
             not be applicable.

|            The editor used by CREATE, EDIT, and PERUSE is specified  by
             logical  name  EDITOR:, so you can find out the name of this
|            program by giving  the  command,  INFORMATION  LOGICAL-NAMES
|            EDITOR:.   The  job-wide  definition  (if any) will be given
|            first, followed by the system-wide definition; the  job-wide
|            definition  prevails  if  both  exist.  If the definition of
             EDITOR:  is SYS:EDIT.EXE, the CREATE and EDIT commands  will
             function  as  described in this manual.  Otherwise, you must
                                                                   ______|            consult the appropriate  manual  (for  example,  the  EDT-20
             _________ ______|            Reference Manaul) for information.

             You can use  the  DEFINE  command  to  define  logical  name
             EDITOR:   to  be  any  editing  program  available  at  your
             installation.  Then this editor will be in effect  when  you


                                     86



             give the CREATE or EDIT command.


   Effect on Memory


        The CREATE command clears memory, then  loads  the  EDIT  program
        into  memory,  and  leaves  your terminal at command level (Input
        mode) in EDIT.

   CREF



|  Runs the CREF program, which produces  cross-reference  listings  from
   files of type .CRF.


   Format


         CREF destination filespec=source filename        @CREF destination filespec=source filename

        where

        destination filespec     is the name of the  file  or  device  to
                                 which  you  want  to  send the processed
                                 contents of the .CRF file
                                      Default                                      Default - LPT:

        source filename          is the name of the .CRF file you want to
                                 process
                                      Default                                      Default - the names of all files of
                                                type .CRF produced during
                                                the   current    terminal
                                                session


   Characteristics


        Current .CRF Files

             If you have  files  of  type  .CRF  produced  by  LOAD-class
             commands during the current terminal session, the unmodified
             command CREF produces  listings  of  them  and  deletes  the
             files.   By  supplying  an argument of the form shown in the
             Format section above, you can copy the listing for a current
             .CRF  file  to  another  file  or  device.   To run the CREF
             program yourself when you have current .CRF files, give  the
             command R CREF instead.

        .CRF Files From a Previous Session

|            If your only files of type .CRF (created by the CREF program
|            or  one  of  the LOAD-class commands) were produced during a
             previous  terminal  session,  the  command  CREF  puts  your
             terminal at command level in the CREF program, symbolized by
             an asterisk (*).  Thus it is equivalent  to  the  command  R
             CREF  in this case.  See Hints - Further Information, below,
             for advice on how to proceed.



                                     89



   Hints


        Producing .CRF Files

             You can produce cross-reference files by including the /CREF
             switch  in  any  LOAD-class  command  that actually causes a
             compilation (i.e., is not  prevented  from  doing  so  by  a
             /RELOCATABLE  switch  or  by the existence of current object
             files).


        Preserving .CRF Files After Processing

             Give the /P switch immediately after  the  CREF  command  to
             preserve  .CRF  files.   Ordinarily  they  are deleted after
             being sent to an output device or copied into another file.

        Further Information

             For  more  detailed  information  about  the  CREF  program,
             including   all  available  switches,  give  the  HELP  CREF
             command.  See Chapter 8 of the TOPS-20 User Utilities  Guide
             for a full description of CREF.


   Effect on Memory and Terminal


|       The CREF command replaces the contents of  any  unkept  forks  in
        memory  with the CREF program and leaves your terminal at TOPS-20
        command level, or at command level within  CREF  (denoted  by  an
        asterisk prompt (*)).


   Related Commands


        LOAD-class commands     for producing .CRF files


   Examples


        1.  Give the CREF command to obtain a listing of your .CRF file.

            @CREF
            CREF:   TESTF1
            @





                                     90



        2.  Compile two FORTRAN  programs,  using  the  /CREF  switch  to
            produce  .CRF  files.   Then  give the CREF command to obtain
            listings of these, and use the /P switch to preserve the .CRF
            files.

            @COMPILE /CREF TESTF1.FOR, TESTF2.FOR
            FORTRAN: TESTF1
            MAIN.
            FORTRAN: TESTF2
            MAIN.
            @CREF/P
            CREF:   TESTF1
            CREF:   TESTF2
            @

        3.  Determine what .CRF files you have, then mount a tape.   Give
            the  CREF command, and once within the CREF program, have the
            cross-reference listing produced  from  one  of  these  files
            copied   onto  tape.   (The  .CRF  files  are  not  processed
            automatically when you give the  CREF  command  because  they
            were produced during a previous terminal session.)


            @DIRECTORY *.CRF

               PS:<LATTA>
             TESTM1.CRF.2

   Caution


        Inefficiency of CSAVE Compared to SAVE

             The CSAVE  command  saves  in  a  compressed-formatted  file
             whatever  program the system finds in memory.  When the file
             is returned to memory, this format prevents other users from
             sharing  the  in-memory  copy  of  the  file.  Therefore you
             should ordinarily use the SAVE command instead  for  storing
             programs in executable format.


   Effect on Memory and Terminal


        The CSAVE command does not affect memory and leaves your terminal
        at TOPS-20 command level.

   Hints


        Using DAYTIME

             The DAYTIME command, which does not require you to be logged
             in,  lets you check the system's clock against your own.  If

                       /USE-SECTION:n
                                      specifies the memory section  (from
                                      0  to  37  octal)  into  which  the
                                      debugging program is to be  loaded,
                                      run, or merged


   Characteristics

        If a Debugging Program is Already Loaded

             If you have already loaded a debugging program  into  memory
             along   with  your  program,  the  DDT  command  starts  the
             debugging program.

        If Your Program, But Not a Debugging Program, is Already Loaded

             If a program containing  symbols  is  in  memory  without  a
|            debugging  program, the DDT command merges SYS:XDDT.EXE into
|            memory, then starts this  debugging  program.   However,  if
|            some  of  XDDT's pages include some of the same pages as the
|            existing program in memory, then  the  DDT  program  is  not
|            placed  into  memory,  and  you  receive  the error message,
|            "?Illegal to overlay existing pages." To force the pages  to
|            be  overlaid,  reissue  the  DDT  command using the /OVERLAY
|            switch.

        If There is No Current Program

|            If you do not have a program in memory, or if no program  in
|            memory  is  in the current fork, or if your program does not
|            contain symbols, the  DDT  command  puts  SYS:XDDT.EXE  into


                                     95



             memory and starts it.
|  
|       Compatibility with Previous DDT Versions
|  
|            The UDDT program run by the DDT command has been replaced by
|            the  XDDT  program.   For  compatibility  with programs that
|            reference UDDT, a stub program  named  UDDT  references  the
|            XDDT program.


   Hints

        Using DDT to Create a Program

             You can use DDT to begin typing instructions  directly  into
             memory,  without  first  putting  it  into  a file for later
|            compilation and loading.  Give a RESET .   (period)  command
|            to  clear the current fork, then the DDT command.  This will
|            load the SYS:XDDT.EXE program.  Then you can  give  commands
|            within XDDT to create your own program.  When using the XDDT
             program, you can use all the symbols in the system parameter
                                          _______ _______ _____ _________             file  MONSYM.MAC.   See  the TOPS-20 Monitor Calls Reference
             ______             Manual for more information about MONSYM.MAC.   This  method
             of  writing  a  program  is  most useful for testing special
             cases, or for learning to use TOPS-20 monitor calls.


   Special Cases

        Using COBDDT

             If you put COBDDT into memory along with  a  COBOL  program,
             the  DDT  command  starts the UDDT program, not COBDDT.  Use
             the REENTER command to start COBDDT in this case.


   Effect on Memory and Terminal

|       The DDT command merges the SYS:UDDT.EXE program into the  current
|       fork  and  starts  it,  or loads and starts SYS:XDDT.EXE.  If you
        have already loaded a debugging program, the DDT  command  starts
        this  program.   In  each  case  your terminal is left at command
        level in the debugging program.


   Related Commands

        DEBUG     for  loading  your  program  along  with  a  particular
                  debugging program (e.g., FORDDT or COBDDT).

|       FORK      for selecting the current fork.

   DEASSIGN



   Releases a device from your job and places the device back in the pool
   of available devices.


   Format


         DEASSIGN          dev:        @DEASSIGN (DEVICE) dev:

             where

             dev:    is the name of the device you want to  deassign;  an
                     asterisk  (*)  deassigns  all  devices  (except your
*                    log-in terminal) assigned to your  job.   The  colon
*                    after the device name is optional.


   Restrictions


        Open Files

             The DEASSIGN command will not  deassign  a  device  that  is
             accessing  an  open  file.   An  error is generated, and the
             device is not deassigned until that file is closed or  until
             you log out.  When you log out, all devices are deassigned.


   Effect on Memory and Terminal


        The DEASSIGN command does  not  affect  memory  and  leaves  your
        terminal at TOPS-20 command level.

   DEBUG



   Loads your  program  into  memory  along  with  a  debugging  program,
   compiling  the  source  file  first  if necessary.  Then it starts the
   debugging program.


   Format


         DEBUG        /switch(es) source/switch(es)  object,...        @DEBUG (FROM) /switch(es) source/switch(es)  object,...

        switches       are  keywords  chosen   from   the   list   below,
                       indicating  your  choice of DEBUG command options.
                       They have different  effects  depending  on  their

                       the file type of 3 or fewer characters; you cannot
                       use  a  generation  number.   This argument is not
                       necessary if you supply an object filespec.

        object         is the file specification of the  object  program.
                       The  filename  must be of six or fewer characters,
                       and the file type must be .REL; you cannot  use  a
                       generation number.  This argument is not necessary
                       if you supply a source filespec.

   Characteristics

        Compiling New Sources Only

             Before debugging programs, the  system  ordinarily  compiles
             any source (and only those sources) whose write date is more
             recent than that of the object file of the same  name.   You
             can  override  this action with the /COMPILE or /RELOCATABLE
             switch.  Note that the DDT debugging program  is  used  when
             /RELOCATABLE prevents a new compilation.

|       Default Switches Not Passed to Compiler
|  
|            Only switches specified in a LOAD-class command  are  passed
|            to  the compiler; default switches are not passed.  Instead,
|            the system assumes that the defaults for  the  compiler  are
|            the same as the defaults for the LOAD-class command.


        Using Standard File Types

             If you specify source files with standard types (.FOR, .MAC,
             .CBL, or.  ALG) in a DEBUG command, the system automatically
             calls  the  appropriate   compiler   when   compilation   is
             necessary.   If  you  specify source files by filename only,
             the system searches your connected directory  in  the  above
             order for a file of this name and a standard type.  To debug
             programs from sources that have nonstandard file types, give
             a  switch to indicate the proper compiler (/FORTRAN, /MACRO,
             /COBOL, or /ALGOL).  A switch will take  precedence  over  a
             standard file type if they indicate different languages.  If
             no compiler is indicated with either a switch or a  standard
             file type, the FORTRAN compiler is used.

        Name of Debugging Program Loaded by DEBUG

             Ordinarily  the  DEBUG  command   causes   the   appropriate
             debugging  program  to  be  loaded  along  with your program
             (FORDDT with FORTRAN programs.  COBDDT with COBOL  programs,
             DDT  with MACRO and ALGOL programs).  Use the /DDT switch to
             specify that DDT be used.


   Hints

        Commas Between Filespecs

             If you give two or more filespecs  separated  by  commas  as
             arguments  to  DEBUG, the loaded programs exist in memory at
             the same time and will act as a single program.  You can use
             this  feature  to  substitute  one  module for another under
             varying conditions or for different applications.


                                    107



        Plus Signs Between Filespecs

             If you give two or more filespecs separated  by  plus  signs
             (+) as arguments to DEBUG, they are treated as a single file
             by compilers.  Their  object  module  is  stored  under  any
             filename  given  as the "object" argument of the command, or
             (if none) under the last filename in the group and file type
             .REL.

        Indirect Files as Arguments

             You can store the arguments (source  and  object  filespecs,
             switches)  of  a  DEBUG  command  in  an  indirect file, and
             specify them by typing an at sign (@) and its filespec as  a
             DEBUG command argument.

        Establishing Default Arguments with the SET Command

             You can issue the SET DEFAULT  COMPILE-SWITCHES  command  to
             set  up  default  global  arguments  to  the  DEBUG command.
             Insert this SET command in your COMAND.CMD  file  to  change
             your own defaults permanently.


        Including all FORTRAN Debugging Information

             If you are debugging a  FORTRAN  program  and  you  wish  to
             examine  line  numbers or DO loops, or use statement tracing
             or array dimension checking, give the  /DEBUG  and  /COMPILE
             switches  with  the  DEBUG  command to include the necessary
             information.


        Running LINK Directly

             The DEBUG command  automatically  runs  LINK,  the  system's
             loader  program,  but  if you require control of the loading
                                                            _______  ____             process you can run LINK directly.   See  the  TOPS-20  LINK

|            %) in a file specification.


   Effect on Memory and Terminal


|       The DEBUG command clears any unkept forks from memory, loads  the
        appropriate  compiler if necessary, then loads your program and a
        compatible debugging program.  It leaves your terminal at program
        command level within the debugging program.

   DEFINE



   Establishes or cancels logical names for your job.


   Format


         DEFINE                name:  list        @DEFINE (LOGICAL NAME) name:  list

        where

        name:        is  any  combination  of  up  to   39   alphanumeric
|                    characters  that  you want to use as a logical name.
                     Use an asterisk (*) for this  argument  to  withdraw
                     all logical names.

        list         is   a   series   of   devices,   file   structures,
                     directories,   file   specifications,  and/or  other
                     logical names; each item should  be  separated  from
                     the others by commas.
                          Default                          Default - not specifying a list  withdraws  the
                                    logical name definition


*  Characteristics
*  
*       Colon Designates a Logical Name
*  
*            When you give a logical name to an EXEC command in the place
*            of  a  filespec,  structure, or directory name, a colon must
*            follow the logical name.
*  
*            In the DEFINE and INFORMATION LOGICAL-NAMES commands,  where
*            the  argument  can only be a logical name, a colon after the
*            logical name is optional.


   Hints


        DEFINE in LOGIN.CMD File

             Your DEFINE  command  is  valid  for  the  current  terminal
             session  only.   If  there are logical names that you always
             want to use, put DEFINE commands into a LOGIN.CMD  (or,  for
             batch  jobs  started  by  SUBMIT commands within the control
             files of other batch jobs, a BATCH.CMD) file in your  log-in
             directory.

        Redefining System Logical Names

             You can use  the  DEFINE  command  to  redefine  any  system
             logical  name  for  your  own  job.   By  repeating a system
             logical  name  in  its  own  search  list  you  expand   its
             definition  to  include  the  other  items, in the order you
             specify.  Consider the system logical name  SYS:,  which  is
             searched  whenever  you  give  a  program name in place of a
             TOPS-20   command.    If   you   redefine   SYS:    to    be
             str:<directory>,    SYS:     you   can   run   programs   in
             str:<directory> by typing just their names.  This will  work
             as  long  as  the  program names are not the same as TOPS-20
             commands.


        Logical Names as Dummy Filespecs

             You can use  logical  names  as  dummies  for  filespecs  or
             devices  when  writing  programs.  Then, just before running
             such a program, use the DEFINE command to  define  these  as
             real  filespecs  or  devices,  without  changing the program
             itself.


        More Information

             For more information about  using  logical  names,  see  the
             _______ ______ _____             TOPS-20 User's Guide.


*  Special Cases
*  
*  
*       Recognition in the Filespec
*  
*            Normally, when you attempt to use  <ESC>  recognition  in  a
*            non-existent  or  non-unique  filename, the system rings the
*            terminal bell.  Instead of ringing the terminal bell in  the
*            DEFINE  command, the system appends .0 or ..0 to the logical
*            name definition.  This  is  because  DEFINE  allows  you  to
*            define a directory or filespec that may not yet exist.
*  
*            Note that a logical name definition that includes .0 or  ..0
*            may  not  work  for  your  use  of  the  logical name; it is
*            recommended that you specify the complete directory name  or
*            file spec.

                                    112



|            You can add a comment to the end of any TOPS-20  command  by
|            preceding the comment with one of the comment characters, an
|            exclamation point (!) or a semicolon (;).  However, only the
|            exclamation point can be used with the DEFINE command.

        Using Short Logical Names Only

             Although logical names can be up to 39 characters  long  and
             can  include  dollar  signs ($), hyphens (-), and underlines
             (_), some commands and programs (e.g.,  programs  originally
             written  for  the  TOPS-10  operating  system) accept a more
             limited set of logical names.  These can be no more  than  6
             characters  long and cannot include any special symbols.  If
             all your logical names  are  of  this  kind,  they  will  be
             acceptable to any TOPS-20 programs and commands.


   Effect on Memory and Terminal


        The DEFINE  command  does  not  affect  memory  and  leaves  your
        terminal at TOPS-20 command level.

   Output


        Whenever an archived file is completely expunged as a  result  of
        your  DELETE  command  (that  is,  when you also give the ARCHIVE
|       subcommand), the operator sends  a  mail  message  notifying  the
        owner  of  the directory from which the file was taken.  For this
        purpose, the owner of the directory is defined to be the user  or
|       users  whose  user  name  appears  in  a  file  of  specification
|       DIRECTORY.OWNER in the directory.  If this file does  not  exist,
|       the  message  is sent to MAIL.TXT which is usually located in the
|       user's login directory.  If neither file exists, the  message  is
|       placed in SYSTEM:FAILED.MAIL.


   Characteristics


        Privileged Subcommands to DELETE

             The DIRECTORY and FORGET subcommands to the  DELETE  command
             are  intended  for privileged users only, and only as a last
             resort, because they withhold freed disk space  from  system
             use.   Users with enabled Wheel or Operator capabilities can
             run  the  CHECKD  program  to  recover  this   disk   space.
             DIRECTORY should not be used unless the KILL subcommand to a
             BUILD command fails to delete the directory.  FORGET is  for
             removing  damaged  files from directories, and should not be
             used unless DELETE without subcommands fails to  delete  the
             file.


                                    116



   Hints


        Removing Open Files

             If DELETE with the EXPUNGE subcommand fails to erase a file,
             it  may  be  that some job in the system has opened it.  The
             INFORMATION FILE-STATUS command tells whether your  own  job
             has  done  so.  If it has, give the CLOSE or (if the file is
             mapped) RESET command before repeating DELETE and EXPUNGE.


        Recovering Deleted Archived Files

             If you have  given  the  DELETE  command  with  the  ARCHIVE
             subcommand to delete an archived file, and the disk copy has
             already been expunged, you may still be able to recover  the
             tape  copy.   The  operator  will  send  a MAIL message (see
             Output, above) concerning the discarded  tape  copy  of  the
             deleted    file.    Use   this   information,   along   with
             Hints - Undoing DISCARD, in the DISCARD command description,
             to attempt recovery of the deleted file.


   Special Cases


        Files With the "Permanent" Attribute

             The system erases only the contents of any files  that  have
             the  Permanent  attribute  (e.g.,  MAIL.TXT  in  your log-in
             directory) when you include them in a DELETE command.  Their
             file  specifications  remain  among  your deleted files, and
             cannot be removed by TOPS-20 commands.


   Restriction


        Using Logical Names When Specifying Files for Deletion

             If you include a logical name when specifying arguments to a
             DELETE  command,  the  system  will search for the specified
             file in only the  first  directory  of  the  logical  name's
             definition.    This   restriction  prevents  the  accidental
             deletion of another file if the file you intended to  delete
             has already been deleted.


   Warning




                                    117



        Erasure of Deleted Files

             Ordinarily  an  UNDELETE  command  given  during  the   same
             terminal  session  as  an original deletion will recover the
             deleted files, unless you included the EXPUNGE subcommand to
             DELETE  or  gave  a subsequent EXPUNGE command.  However, if
             any user or a batch job logs out  while  connected  to  your
             directory,  all deleted files are permanently erased.  Also,
             if available disk space is low on the system,  the  operator
|            or  the  system  itself may expunge all deleted files from a
|            structure even though you have not logged  out.   A  warning
             message is usually sent before this happens.


   Effect on Memory and Terminal


        The DELETE  command  does  not  affect  memory  and  leaves  your
        terminal at TOPS-20 command level.

   DEPOSIT



|  Modifies the contents of a specific memory location.

   Format

         DEPOSIT                   address            data        @DEPOSIT (MEMORY LOCATION) address (CONTENTS) data

        where

        address     is an octal number or a symbol

        data        is a symbolic or numerical expression

   Output

        Status of Pages

             When you complete a DEPOSIT command, the system gives you  a
             message  indicating the status of the page you are trying to
             change:    "[New]"   for   previously   nonexistent   pages,
             "[Shared]" for those having Copy-on-Write status, or "?Can't
             write that page" for other pages.  (See also Hints - Setting
             the  Page-access  of  Memory  Pages,  below.)   However,  no
             message is printed for deposits made to private pages.

   Hints

        Using Symbols

             For symbols that  are  defined  in  multiple  modules  of  a
             program,  you  can  be  specific  by  giving the module name
             followed by an ampersand (&) and the symbol name.

        Using DDT Instead

             Usually the DEPOSIT  command  is  unnecessary,  as  the  DDT
             program  provides  more  powerful  methods for modifying the
             contents of memory.

        Abbreviating DEPOSIT Arguments

             The contents of each memory location are represented as  two
             6-digit  octal  numbers.   By  inserting  a  pair  of commas
             between these two numbers, you  can  abbreviate  them.   For
             example,   to  deposit  000004000050  into  memory  location
             151003, use the command

                  @DEPOSIT 151003 4,,50



                                    120



             This is the same as

                  @DEPOSIT 151003 4000050

             Note that you can also insert  commas  between  expressions.
             For example, the command

                  @DEPOSIT 1 1+3,, 5+7

             deposits 000004000014 into memory location 1.   (Expressions
             are  considered to be octal unless they contain an 8 or a 9,
             in which case they are considered  to  be  decimal  and  are
             translated to octal.)

             The DEPOSIT command itself can be abbreviated by the  single
             letter D.

        Deposit Address Defaults to the One Examined, and Vice Versa

             The first argument of a  DEPOSIT  command  defaults  to  the
             address  examined by your most recent EXAMINE command.  (You
             must press the  ESCAPE  key  to  take  this  default.)   The
             argument of an EXAMINE command defaults to the address whose
             contents were modified by your most recent DEPOSIT  command.
             Therefore  you  can examine a memory location, deposit a new
             value in it, and verify your action,  while  specifying  the
             location  only  once.   If you give DEPOSIT commands without
             intervening EXAMINE commands (or vice  versa),  the  default
             address increases by 1 for each subsequent command.

        Setting the Page-access of Memory Pages

             If the system responds to a DEPOSIT command  with  an  error
             message  of the form, "?Can't write that page", give the SET
             PAGE-ACCESS COPY-ON-WRITE command for the page.   Then  give
             DEPOSIT  again.   If the system allows it, you will be given
             your own copy of the page to modify.

        Using DEPOSIT With Inferior Processes

             To  modify  memory  for  a  process  inferior  to  the   one
             immediately  below  the  TOPS-20 command processor, you must
             give the FORK command to specify this process  before  using
             DEPOSIT.   Remember that for an inferior process to run, all
             superior  processes  must  be  running   too.    INFORMATION
             PROGRAM-STATUS tells you which processes these are.


   Effect on Memory and Terminal

        The DEPOSIT command changes one location  in  memory  and  leaves
        your terminal at TOPS-20 command level.

        argument                 can be one of these:

   Characteristics


        Effects of Detached Jobs

             Detached jobs use scarce system  resources  (e.g.,  swapping
             space,  process  slots, job slots) and can prevent new users
             from logging in.


   Warning


        Programs Writing to the Controlling Terminal (Device TTY:)

             If a program running in a detached job attempts to write  to
             device TTY:, the job will wait until it is again attached to
             a terminal.



                                    124



   Effect on Memory, Job, and Terminal


        The DETACH command affects your job according to the argument you
        select,  and  leaves  your terminal disengaged from the system in
        the state before log-in.  It  does  not  affect  memory  for  the
        detached job.


   Related Commands

        SYSTAT       for finding out which jobs are detached

        SUBMIT       for running independent jobs

        UNATTACH     for disengaging another job from its terminal


   Examples


        1.  Detach your job.

            @DETACH
            Detaching job # 16

        2.  Detach your job while starting the program  in  memory,  then
            log in again.

            @DETACH START
             Detaching job # 45

            @

        3.  Log in and put a program in  memory;  detach  the  job  while
            starting  this program, and repeat the entire procedure.  Log
            in a third time and  begin  execution  of  a  third  program.
            Interrupt  this execution with CTRL/C, then detach this third
            job while continuing its program.  Now you  have  three  jobs
            running  at  once.   Instead  of logging in again, attach the
            first job (specifying the job number) and verify the system's
            action.

   Hints

        Listing Unneeded Files

             In preparation for deleting files  so  that  your  directory
             will  fall  within  disk  quotas, you can get a list of your
             largest files by using the LARGER and/or  SIZE  subcommands,
             and  of  your  oldest or least-used files with DATES, TIMES,
             and BEFORE.  With FIND you can discover extra generations of
             files.


        Finding Files of a Particular Age or Size

             To examine only files of a certain age  or  size,  give  the
             pair of subcommands BEFORE and SINCE, or LARGER and SMALLER,
             with appropriate arguments.


        Comparing Checksums of Files

             You can use the numbers reported by the CHECKSUM  subcommand
             to  compare two files:  if they have differing contents they
             will almost certainly yield different values; and  identical
             files will have the same checksums.  The CHECKSUM subcommand
             causes a checksum of checksums as well.


   Special Cases

        Asterisks Appearing Before Filespecs

             An asterisk (*) appearing before a filename in the  response
             to a DIRECTORY command indicates a possible hardware-related
             error, one caused  by  a  read  operation  at  a  marginally
             functional  area of disk.  To test whether there actually is
             an error in the file, use the COPY command to copy the  file


                                    133



             to a new specification.  If the COPY command succeeds, there
             is no error in the file, and no asterisk  will  precede  the
             new  file  specification.   If  the  COPY command fails, you
             should move  the  disk  to  another  drive  and  repeat  the
             command.   If it still fails, you may have to write your own
             program to recover everything but the missing  part  of  the
             file (usually, just one page).

        DIRECTORY-class Commands for Labeled Magnetic Tapes

             The FDIRECTORY,  TDIRECTORY,  and  VDIRECTORY  commands  for
             labeled  magnetic  tapes  are  equivalent  to  the DIRECTORY
             command for labeled  magnetic  tapes.   All  these  commands
             rewind  the  tape  set to the beginning of the first volume,
             print a directory of files, then rewind the set again.   You
             can  give  only these subcommands when using DIRECTORY-class
             commands  with  labeled  magnetic  tapes:    ALPHABETICALLY,
             DOUBLESPACE,   HEADING,   LPT,   NO,  OUTPUT,  REVERSE,  and
             SEPARATE.


   Effect on Memory and Terminal

        The DIRECTORY command does not  affect  memory  and  leaves  your
        terminal at TOPS-20 command level.

   Disables any special capabilities, such as those of Wheel or Operator,
   that you have enabled.


   Format

        @


   Characteristics


        Resumption of Standard Prompt

             The DISABLE command causes the system to resume the standard
             at  sign  prompt (@) in place of the dollar sign prompt ($),
             which indicated enabled capabilities.


   Warning


        Disabling Promptly

             Be sure to disable your capabilities as  soon  as  you  have
             finished using them, so that you or a program you run cannot
             accidentally damage the system.


   Effect on Memory and Terminal


        The DISABLE command  does  not  affect  memory  and  leaves  your
        terminal at TOPS-20 command level.

   DISCARD



   Gives up the tape copy of specified on-line files.


   Format


         DISCARD                              filespec,...        @DISCARD (TAPE INFORMATION FOR FILES) filespec,...

        where

        filespec                      is  the  specification  of  a  file
                                      whose tape copy you want to discard

        ,...                          means that  after  commas  you  can
                                      give more file specifications.


   Characteristics


        Action of DISCARD

             The DISCARD command causes the tape pointer in the FDB (File
             Descriptor  Block)  of the specified file to be deleted.  It
|            does not actually destroy the tape copy of  the  file.   The
|            tape  copy  is  destroyed  when  the tape is recycled by the
|            operator.  (See also Hints - Undoing DISCARD, below.)

        Withdrawing Archive Status of Files

             When you give the DISCARD command for  an  on-line  archived
             file,  you withdraw archive status from the disk copy of the
             file.  That is, the file  becomes  an  ordinary  disk  file,
             which you can edit or delete if you wish.

        DISCARD for Non-archived Files

             You can also use the DISCARD command to  give  up  the  tape
             copy   of   files   that   have   been   migrated   to  tape
             (automatically, by the system) and then retrieved using  the
             RETRIEVE command.


   Hints


        Undoing DISCARD



                                    139



             You receive a MAIL message from the operator for every  file
             whose  tape  copy  you  discard.  The message gives the tape
             number, saveset number, and file number within  the  saveset
             of  each  tape  copy.  If you have given the DISCARD command
             for a file and later wish to use the tape copy, you  may  be
             able  to  recover  it using this information, as long as the
             tapes have not yet been recycled.


   Effect on Memory and Terminal


        The DISCARD command does  not  affect  memory,  and  leaves  your
        terminal at TOPS-20 command level.

   Characteristics


        Action of DISMOUNT STRUCTURE Command


             Ordinary DISMOUNT STRUCTURE

                  The DISMOUNT STRUCTURE command reduces by 1  the  mount
                  count  of  the specified structure (i.e., the number of
                  users who have given a MOUNT but not a DISMOUNT command
                  for  the  structure)  if you had given a previous MOUNT
                  command for it.  An ordinary DISMOUNT STRUCTURE command
                  does not withdraw the structure from system use.


             Including /REMOVE Switch

                  If you include  the  /REMOVE  switch  when  giving  the


                                    143



                  DISMOUNT  STRUCTURE command, the specified structure is
                  made  unavailable  for  further  mount  requests.   The
                  operator  is informed of your dismount request, and any
                  further action depends  on  him.   If  he  denies  your
                  request, the structure is again made available to other
                  users; if he grants your request, the structure remains
                  unavailable  for  further  mount requests, and is taken
                  off  line  and  physically  removed.    Under   extreme
                  conditions  the  operator may take a structure off line
                  and physically remove it even though  some  users  have
                  not dismounted the structure.  Before doing so, he will
                  usually send a message to such users to allow  them  to
                  close their files.

        Action of DISMOUNT TAPE Command

             The DISMOUNT TAPE  command  unloads  the  currently  mounted
             volume   of   the  specified  tape  set  (i.e.,  rewinds  it
             completely  onto  its  source  reel)  so  that  it  can   be
             physically  removed  by  the  operator, and returns the tape
             drive to the pool of available resources.  (Note that if the
             /NOUNLOAD  switch  was given in your original MOUNT command,
             no volumes are unloaded by the  system  or  removed  by  the
             operator, even after your DISMOUNT command is completed.) If
             a logical name (e.g., the setname of the tape set)  is  used
             in  the DISMOUNT command to specify the tape set, the system
             also withdraws the definition  of  the  logical  name.   Use
             DISMOUNT  TAPE  only  for tape drives having device names of
             the  form  MTn:,  i.e.,  drives  obtained  using  the  MOUNT
             command.   Use  UNLOAD  to  unload  tapes from drives having
             device names of the form MTAn:.


   Hints


        Omitting "medium" Argument

             If the dev:  argument  of  your  DISMOUNT  command  will  be
             unambiguous  (i.e.,  you  do not have both a structure and a
             tape set mounted using the same device name), you  need  not
             specify   the   medium.   The  shortened  command,  DISMOUNT
             dev:/switch(es), is sufficient.

        Using the /STRUCTURE-ID Switch

             The /STRUCTURE-ID switch gives the name of the structure  as
             recorded in the disk(s) of the pack itself, where it is used
             by the system for identification.  You may use  this  switch
             to dismount a structure that had been mounted using an alias
             different from its structure identification.  (See  Hints  -
             Using   the  /STRUCTURE-ID  Switch,  in  the  MOUNT  command


                                    144



             description.)


        Using INFORMATION VOLUMES before DISMOUNT TAPE

             If  you  give  the  INFORMATION   VOLUMES   command   before
             dismounting  a tape set, the system will respond with a list
             of the volids for mounted volumes, including volids for  any
             volumes  newly  added  to  the  set.   You  should  keep  an
             up-to-date record  of  these  for  use  with  further  MOUNT
             commands.


   Effect on Memory and Terminal


        The DISMOUNT command does not affect memory,  and,  if  you  have
        included  the  /NOWAIT  switch,  leaves  your terminal at TOPS-20
        command level.  If you have not given the  /NOWAIT  switch,  your
        terminal  waits  until  the system has processed your request, or
        until you give a CTRL/C to return to TOPS-20 command level.  This
        CTRL/C does not cancel your request.

                           the file's original specification

        /OPTION:name       sets any EDIT switches contained in  lines  of

                           or fewer characters).  The system expects this
                           file to be in your log-in directory.

        /PLINES:n          specifies how many lines to print in  response

                           sign) are not ordinary textual characters  but
                           are field separators in the accompanying file

        /SEQUENCE          tells the EDIT program not to strip  the  line
                           numbers  from  the  file when the EDIT session
                           ends

   Characteristics


        Edit Mode or Input Mode

             The EDIT command runs the EDIT system program in Edit  mode,
             which  uses  an  asterisk  prompt  (*).   (However, see also
             Special Cases - Using an Editor Other than EDIT, below.)  In
             Edit  mode  you  can use any EDIT program commands to modify
             the specified file.  If the EDIT program starts by  printing
             the  word Input instead of Edit, the specified file does not
             yet exist.  You are then in Input mode, just as if  you  had
             used  the  CREATE  command  instead of EDIT.  See the CREATE
             command description for details.


        Saving Backup Files Periodically

             Whenever you use EDIT, be sure to keep an extra copy of  the
             file  you  are  modifying,  in case of a system failure.  By
             default the system renames the unedited copy of your file to
             name.Qyp  at  the  end  of an editing session.  By using the
             /SAVE:n  switch  you  can  have  this  backup  file  updated
             periodically  during  the  editing  session  to reflect your
             edits.

        SWITCH.INI File

             If there is a group of EDIT command switches that you always
             or  often  use with EDIT or CREATE commands, put them into a
             file of specification SWITCH.INI in your  log-in  directory,
             in  a line of that file beginning with "EDIT:abc", where abc
             is any set of characters you choose to  identify  the  line.
             Then  if  you include the single switch /OPTION:abc when you
             give an EDIT or CREATE command, all these switches  will  be
             in effect.

        Debugging Your Programs and Editing the Sources

             You can use EDIT to modify files containing source  programs
             written  in  a  programming  language.   The  DDT  and DEBUG
             commands run system programs that offer more  efficient  and
             powerful  techniques  for  testing  temporary corrections to
             your programs, but you should use the EDIT command  to  make
             final changes to the source files.

        Further Information

                                                                  _______             For more information about the EDIT program, see the TOPS-20
             ____ _________ ______             EDIT Reference Manual.


   Special Cases


        Using an Editor Other than EDIT

|            The CREATE, EDIT, and PERUSE command  descriptions  in  this
             manual  assume  that these commands call on the EDIT program
|            for their action.  If your job uses another editing program,
|            for  example  EDT, the switches and examples shown here will
|            not be applicable.
|  
|            The editor used by CREATE, EDIT, and PERUSE is specified  by
             logical  name  EDITOR:, so you can find out the name of this
|            program by giving  the  command,  INFORMATION  LOGICAL-NAMES
|            EDITOR:.   The  job-wide  definition  (if any) will be given
|            first, followed by the system-wide definition; the  job-wide
|            definition  prevails  if  both  exist.  If the definition of
|            EDITOR:  is SYS:EDIT.EXE, the CREATE and EDIT commands  will
             function  as  described in this manual.  Otherwise, you must
                                                                   ______|            consult the appropriate  manual  (for  example,  the  EDT-20
             _________ ______|            Reference Manual) for information.

             You can use  the  DEFINE  command  to  define  logical  name
             EDITOR:   to  be  any  editing  program  available  at  your
             installation.  Then this program will be in effect when  you
             give the CREATE or EDIT command.

        Attempting to Edit Archived Files

             If you attempt to edit an on-line archived file, the  system
             will let you produce an edited version of the archived file,
             but will retain the original (archived) file unchanged under
             the  specification name.Qyp (or name.Zyp if you included the
             /OLD switch in the EDIT  command),  where  name.typ  is  the
             file's  original  specification.   See  also Hints - Editing
             Files of Type .Qyp, below.



                                    154



        Editing Files of Type .Qyp

             If you edit a file of type .Qyp (i.e., any file  whose  type
             begins  with  the  letter Q), the EDIT program does not save
             the unedited copy as a backup file.  In such cases, give the
             /OLD  switch  to  retain  the  unedited copy under file type
             .Zyp.  If the file of type .Qyp is  an  archived  file,  you
             will  not be allowed to produce an altered version using the
             EDIT command unless you include the /OLD switch.


   Effect on Memory and Terminal


|       The EDIT command clears any unkept forks from memory, then  loads
|       the  EDIT system program into memory, and leaves your terminal at

   ENABLE



|  Enables any special capabilities you may have.


   Format


         ENABLE        @ENABLE (CAPABILITIES)
        $


   Characteristics


        Dollar Sign Prompt

             The ENABLE command causes the system to print a dollar  sign
             prompt ($), indicating enabled capabilities, in place of the
             standard at sign prompt (@).   The  dollar  sign  prompt  is
             printed  after  ENABLE even if you have not been granted any
             capabilities.

        Capabilities of Log-In Directory Only

|            The ENABLE command activates only  those  capabilities  that
             have  been  granted  to  the owner of your log-in directory.
             You do not receive any capabilities as a result  of  CONNECT
             or ACCESS commands or group memberships.
|  
|       Capabilities Changed While Logged In
|  
|            Capabilities are given to your job when you log in.  If your
|            capabilities  are  changed while you are logged-in, you must
|            log out and log in again for the change to take effect.


|  Hints
|  
|  
|       Displaying Capabilities
|  
|            Capabilities are defined by your login directory but  are  a
|            characteristic  of  your  job  and  can  be  ENABLEd  in any
|            directory to which you connect.  To list your  capabilities,
|            give  the  INFORMATION  DIRECTORY  command  for  your  login
|            directory.
|  
|       More Information



                                    157



|            Capabilities are assigned with the BUILD command.   See  the
|            BUILD   command   subcommands   in  this  manual  for  brief
|            descriptions of the function of special capabilities.


   Special Cases


        Dollar Sign Prompt in Batch Jobs

             Because a dollar sign placed in the location  of  a  TOPS-20
             prompt  could  be  confused with a batch command, the system
             precedes the enabled prompt with a space for batch jobs.


   Warning


        Disabling Capabilities Promptly

             Because your commands are much more  powerful  if  you  have
             capabilities enabled, you should disable them as soon as you
             have finished using them.  Otherwise you or a  program  that
             you run could accidentally damage the system.


   Effect on Memory and Terminal


        The ENABLE  command  does  not  affect  memory  and  leaves  your
        terminal at TOPS-20 command level.


   Related Commands


        DISABLE                   for suspending  any  capabilities  that
                                  the system manager has given you

        INFORMATION DIRECTORY     for finding out which capabilities,  if
                                  any,  have been granted to the owner of
                                  a directory


   Examples


        1.  Enable your capabilities.

            @ENABLE
            $



                                    158



        2.  Try to assign a plotter to your job before taking it off line
            for  repairs.   But  it  is already assigned to another user,
            whose  terminal  is  set  to  refuse  links.    Enable   your
            capabilities  and  ask  him  to  deassign  the plotter.  Then
            disable capabilities.

   END-ACCESS



   Terminates your ownership rights to an accessed directory, as well  as
   group rights borrowed from its owner.


   Format


         END-ACCESS                dev:<directory>        @END-ACCESS (TO DIRECTORY) dev:<directory>

        where

        dev:<directory>     is the directory to which  you  want  to  end
                            access
                                 Default                                 Default dev: - your connected structure

                                 Default                                 Default <directory> - the directory  (on
                                                       the      specified
                                                       structure) of  the
                                                       same  name as your
                                                       connected
                                                       directory


   Hints


        Implicit END-ACCESS

             You can access only one directory at a time on each  mounted
             structure.   Each ACCESS command ends access obtained by any
             previous ACCESS command for a  directory  on  the  specified
             structure.  Therefore you do not need to give the END-ACCESS
             command if you access another directory on the structure, or
             if the structure is dismounted.

        Restoring Previous Rights

             END-ACCESS does not restore owner and group rights  obtained
             by  a  previous  ACCESS command for the specified structure.
             Give another ACCESS command to regain these.  (Note that you
             must  access  your  log-in  directory to regain group rights
             obtained by the LOGIN command,  lost  by  accessing  another
             directory on the public structure.


   Effect on Memory and Terminal




                                    160



        The END-ACCESS command does not affect  memory  and  leaves  your
        terminal at TOPS-20 command level.

        1.  Give up your access rights to another user's directory.

            @END-ACCESS <HOLLAND>
            @

        2.  Access another user's directory, copy a  file  from  it,  and
            give  up your rights to it.  Then give a command that depends
            on your own  group  rights.   (It  fails.)  Access  your  own
            directory   to  establish  these,  and  repeat  the  command,
            successfully this time.

            @ACCESS <HOLLAND>
            Password:
            @COPY <HOLLAND>DIST.LST

   EOF



   Writes an end-of-file mark on the specified magnetic tape.   Use  this
   command for unlabeled tapes only.


   Format


         EOF          dev:        @EOF (DEVICE) dev:

        where

        dev:      is the name of the magnetic tape  drive  on  which  you
*                 want to write an end-of-file mark.  The colon after the
*                 device name is optional.


   Hints


        EOF Seldom Needed

             Because tape-writing  programs  and  commands  automatically
             write  end-of-file  marks  in the appropriate places, you do
             not ordinarily need the EOF command.  But it can  be  useful
             if  such  a  program  is interrupted (by your CTRL/C or by a
             system failure and restart) and you  want  to  preserve  the
             information already written.  Also, you can shorten files on
             an existing tape by giving an EOF  command  at  the  desired
             point.


   Restrictions


        EOF With Open Files

             If you have given a CTRL/C to exit from a program  that  has
             opened  a  magnetic  tape  drive  and  you then give the EOF
             command for that tape drive, the system will first allow you
             to  close  the  associated file.  You must do so for the EOF
             command to succeed, but  you  will  probably  be  unable  to
             continue  the program from that point, because the file will
             now be closed.


   Effect on Memory and Terminal




                                    163



        The EOF command does not affect memory and leaves  your  terminal

|  Characteristics

|  
|       Characteristics of an Ephemeral Fork
|  
|            A program that runs in an ephemeral fork acts like  an  EXEC
|            command  (excluding those EXEC commands that run programs or
|            otherwise affect memory).  Ephemeral forks and EXEC commands
|            share these characteristics:
|  
|             o  They do not affect programs in memory.  For example,  if
|                you  exit a program and issue a SYSTAT command, or run a
|                program in an ephemeral fork, neither  the  command  nor
|                the ephemeral fork will disturb the program in memory.
|  
|                A program that runs ephemerally is always  placed  in  a
|                new fork.
|  
|             o  They  disappear  when  interrupted  or  when  processing
|                completes.   For  example,  if  you  stop execution of a
|                SYSTAT command or an ephemeral fork with CTRL/C, neither
|                the command nor the ephemeral fork can be continued.
|  
|                Whenever you stop or exit an ephemeral fork, the fork is
|                automatically reset.
|  
|            Good candidates for ephemeral forks are  programs  that  may
|            have short execution times and simply display information in
|            a manner similar to the INFORMATION and SYSTAT commands.

   EXAMINE



   Displays the contents of a specific memory location.

   Format

         EXAMINE                   octal or symbolic address        @EXAMINE (MEMORY LOCATION) octal or symbolic address

   Output

        Contents of Memory Location or Message

             When you complete an EXAMINE command, the system prints  the
             memory  address  examined,  followed  by a slash (/) and its
             contents.  If you  previously  used  the  SET  TYPEOUT  MODE
             SYMBOLIC  command, this information is both in symbolic and,
             in  parentheses,  numeric  (octal)  format.   (The   numeric
             information  will  always  appear  for  this  setting of the
             command; symbolic information  will  appear  if  the  system
             finds that it is different from the numeric.)

             Generally the numeric format shows two 6-digit octal numbers
             separated  by a pair of commas (,,).  If you do not see this
             pair of commas, only the right half of the  memory  location
             is  being displayed; as the left half is 0.  However, if you
             are not permitted  to  examine  this  location,  the  system
             prints only a message telling you of the restriction.

   Hints

        Using Symbols

             For symbols that  are  defined  in  multiple  modules  of  a
             program,  you  can  be  specific  by  giving the module name
             followed by an ampersand (&) and the symbol name.

        Abbreviating EXAMINE

             The EXAMINE command can be abbreviated by the single  letter
             E.

        Default Argument for EXAMINE

             The argument of your current EXAMINE command defaults  to  a
             value  greater by 1 than the last address examined, allowing
             you to inspect a section of memory with only  a  minimum  of
             typing.   But if you gave a more recent DEPOSIT command, the
             argument of your current EXAMINE command  defaults  to  that
             address, allowing you to verify the deposit.

|       Using EXAMINE With Noncurrent and Inferior Forks
|  
|            The EXAMINE command displays memory locations of the current
|            fork.   To  examine  the  memory  of  noncurrent or inferior
|            forks, make the fork the current fork  by  giving  the  FORK
|            command with the fork name or number as an argument.

|            Remember that to run an inferior fork  after  examining  it,
|            you  must  ensure  that  all superior forks are running too.
|            Give the CONTINUE command with the  superior  fork  name  or
|            number  as an argument to let the superior fork continue its
|            inferiors.

   Effect on Memory and Terminal

        The EXAMINE command  does  not  affect  memory  and  leaves  your
        terminal at TOPS-20 command level.

   EXECUTE



   Loads your program into memory, compiling the  source  file  first  if
   necessary.  Then it starts the program.


   Format


         EXECUTE        /switch(es) source/switch(es) object,...        @EXECUTE (FROM) /switch(es) source/switch(es) object,...

        where

        switches     are keywords chosen from the list below,  indicating
                     your  choice  of EXECUTE command options.  They have
                     different effects depending on their position in the
                     command  line:   placed  before  all  files  in  the
                     command, they act on  defaults  for  all;  otherwise
                     they affect only the nearest preceding file.
                          Defaults                          Defaults  are shown in the list of switches

        source       is the file specification  of  the  source  program.
                     The  filename  must be of 6 or fewer characters, and
                     the file type of 30 fewer characters; you cannot use
                     a generation number.  This argument is not necessary
                     if you supply an object filespec.

        object       is the file specification  of  the  object  program.
                     The filename must be of six or fewer characters, and
                     the file  type  must  be  .REL;  you  cannot  use  a
                     generation  number.   This argument is not necessary
                     if you supply a source.
                          Default                          Default (if you give neither source nor  object

        system  will  not  reject  switches  described  under  any of the
        LOAD-class commands, only those switches commonly associated with
        EXECUTE are described here.


                            EXECUTE Command Switches


|       /10-BLISS         compiles the file using the BLISS-10 compiler.
                               Default|                              Default for files of type .B10 and .BLI
|  
|       /36-BLISS         compiles the file using the BLISS-36 compiler.
                               Default|                              Default for files of type .B36

        /68-COBOL         compiles the file using the COBOL-68 compiler.


                                    172



                               Default|                              Default for files of type .C68 or .68C

        /74-COBOL         compiles the file using the COBOL-74 compiler.
                               Default|                              Default for files of type .C74 or .74C

|       /ABORT            stops a compile if a fatal  error  is  detected
|                         and  returns  your  terminal to TOPS-20 command
|                         level.

        /ALGOL            compiles the file using the ALGOL compiler.
                               Default|                              Default for files of type .ALG
|  
|       /BINARY           allows generation of an  object  (binary)  file
|                         for each source file given.
                               Default|                              Default

|       /COBOL            compiles the file  using  the  COBOL  compiler,
|                         either   COBOL-68   or   COBOL-74,   that  your
|                         installation   has   stored   in    the    file
|                         SYS:COBOL.EXE.
                               Default|                              Default for files of type .CBL

        /COMPILE          forces compilation of the source file even if a
                          current  object  file already exists.  Use this
                          switch along with a /LIST or  /CREF  switch  to
                          obtain  listings  when  you have current object
                          files.

        /CREF             same as /CROSS-REFERENCE.

|       /CROSS-REFERENCE
                          creates  a  file   containing   cross-reference
                          information  for  each  compilation.   The file
                          name is that of the object file; the file  type
                          is  .CRF.   Use  the  CREF  command to obtain a
                          listing of the file.   (For  COBOL  files  this
                          switch automatically produces a cross-reference
                          listing.)



|       /FAIL             compiles the file using the FAIL compiler.
                               Default|                              Default for files of type .FAI
|  
|       /FLAG-NON-STANDARD
|                         indicates nonstandard syntax in a file

        /FORTRAN          compiles the file using the FORTRAN compiler.
                               Default                               Default  for switches specifying  compiler
                                        language,  in  the  absence  of a
                                        standard source file type
                               Default|                              Default  for files of type .FOR


                                    173



        /LANGUAGE-SWITCHES:"/switch(es)"
                          passes the specified switches to  the  compiler
                          that  will  process  the  file(s) to which this
                          switch applies.  You must include the  switches
                          in double quotation marks ("  ").

        /LIBRARY          same as /SEARCH.

        /LIST             prints a line printer listing of the program in
                          ASCII  format;  the name of this listing is the
                          filename of the object file.  The /CREF  switch
                          overrides  /LIST  when  they  both apply to the
                          same file.

|       /MAC              same as /MACRO.
|  

|       /MACHINE-CODE     produces  a  files  containing  the   generated
|                         machine  code.   The  filename  is  that of the
|                         object  file;  the  file  type  is  .LST.   For
|                         high-level languages.

|       /MACRO            assembles the file using the MACRO assembler.
                               Default|                              Default for files of type .MAC

        /MAP              produces a loader map and stores it in the file
                          object.MAP,  where  object  is  the name of the
                          module containing the start address; or (if  no
                          start  address)  nnnLNK.MAP,  where nnn is your
                          job number.

|       /NOBINARY         prevents generation of an object (binary) file.
|                         Use  this  switch  along with /LIST or /CREF to
|                         allow these switches  to  take  effect  without
|                         producing a new object file.

|       /NOCOMPILE        prevents compilation  if  the  object  file  is
|                         current;   otherwise   it  forces  compilation.
|                         Cancels the /COMPILE or /RELOCATABLE switch.
|  
|       /NOCREF           same as NOCROSS-REFERENCE.

|       /NOCROSS-REFERENCE
|                         prevents  the  creation  of  a  cross-reference
|                         file.
                               Default|                              Default

|       /NOFLAG-NON-STANDARD
|                         prevents the flagging of non-standard syntax in
|                         the file.

        /NOLIBRARY        same as /NOSEARCH.

   Characteristics

        Compiling New Sources Only

             Before executing programs, the  system  ordinarily  compiles
             any source (and only those sources) whose write date is more
             recent that that of the object file of the same  name.   You
             can  override  this action with the /COMPILE or /RELOCATABLE
             switch.

        Using Standard File Types

             If you specify source files with standard types (.FOR, .MAC,
             .CBL,   or   .ALG)   in  an  EXECUTE  command,   the  system
             automatically   calls   the   appropriate   compiler    when
             compilation  is  necessary.   If you specify source files by
             filename only,  the system searches your connected directory
             in  the  above  order for a file of this name and a standard
             type.   To  execute  programs   from   sources   that   have
             nonstandard file types, give a switch to indicate the proper
             compiler (/FORTRAN, /MACRO, /COBOL, or  /ALGOL).   A  switch
             will  take  precedence  over  a  standard  file type if they
             indicate different languages.  If no compiler  is  indicated
             with  either  a  switch or a standard file type, the FORTRAN
             compiler is used.

|       Default Switches Not Passed to Compiler



                                    176



|            Only switches specified in a LOAD-class command  are  passed
|            to  the compiler; default switches are not passed.  Instead,
|            the system assumes that the defaults for  the  compiler  are
|            the same as the defaults for the LOAD-class command.

   Hints

        Commas Between Filespecs

             If you give two or more filespecs  separated  by  commas  as
             arguments to EXECUTE, the loaded programs exist in memory at
             the same time and will act as a single program.  You can use
             this  feature  to  substitute  one  module for another under
             varying conditions or for different applications.

        Plus Signs Between Filespecs

             If you give two or more filespecs separated  by  plus  signs
             (+)  as  arguments  to EXECUTE, they are treated as a single
             file by compilers.  Their object module is stored under  any
             filename  given  as the "object" argument of the command, or
             (if none) under the last filename in the group and file type
             .REL.


        Indirect Files as Arguments

             You can store the arguments (source  and  object  filespecs,
             switches)  of  an  EXECUTE  command in an indirect file, and
             specify them by typing an at sign (@) and its filespec as an
             EXECUTE command argument.

        Establishing Default Arguments with the SET Command

             You can issue the SET DEFAULT  COMPILE-SWITCHES  command  to
             set  up  default  global  arguments  to the EXECUTE command.
             Insert this SET command in your COMAND.CMD  file  to  change
             your own defaults permanently.

        Running LINK Directly

             The EXECUTE command automatically runs  LINK,  the  system's
             loader  program,  but  if you require control of the loading
                                                            _______  ____             process you can run LINK directly.   See  the  TOPS-20  LINK

   Effect on Memory and Terminal


|       The EXECUTE command clears any unkept forks  from  memory,  loads
        the appropriate compiler if necessary, then loads and starts your
        program.  It leaves your terminal at program  command  level  (if
        any) within your program.

   Output


        After a successful EXPUNGE command, the system reports the number
|       of disk pages freed with the message [n pages freed].  If deleted
|       files are mapped, they will not be  expunged,  and  so  will  not
        contribute to the number of pages freed.  Occasionally the system
        will report a negative number.  This can  mean  that  files  were
        being written in the directory during the EXPUNGE, or (especially
        if you include the REBUILD subcommand) that previous computations
        of  directory  size  had not adequately accounted for some files,
        for example, files written near the time of a  system  crash  and
        reload.


   Hints


        Using the REBUILD Subcommand

             The REBUILD subcommand is not needed under usual conditions,
             as  the  system  performs  this  action  automatically.  Use
             REBUILD if a message is printed on  your  terminal  advising
|            you to rebuild the symbol table of a directory.

        Using the PURGE Subcommand

             The PURGE subcommand is  useful  chiefly  for  removing  the
             remains  of  files  that were being created at the time of a
             system crash or a structure dismount.  Do not give it  while
             anyone  might  be  using  the directory, because that user's
             program might be deprived of necessary files as a result.


   Special Cases


        Files With the "Permanent" Attribute

             The system erases only the contents of any files  that  have
             the  Permanent  attribute,  for  example your MAIL.TXT file,
             when you try to expunge them.  The  file  specifications  of
             permanent  files remain among your deleted files, and cannot
             be removed by TOPS-20 commands.

   Effect on Memory and Terminal


        The EXPUNGE command  does  not  affect  memory  and  leaves  your
        terminal at TOPS-20 command level.

   FDIRECTORY



   The FDIRECTORY (Full DIRECTORY) command is equivalent to the DIRECTORY
   command with the subcommands CRAM, EVERYTHING, and NOHEADING.  Use the
   same format and subcommands with FDIRECTORY as  with  DIRECTORY.   For
   further  information,  see  the  DIRECTORY command description in this
   manual.

   When used with magnetic tapes, the FDIRECTORY command is equivalent to
   DIRECTORY for magnetic tapes.


   Examples


        1.  Get a "Full DIRECTORY" listing, on your terminal, for one  of
            your files.

            @FDIRECTORY TESTF1.FOR

            the  only  piece  of  information  about  current  files  not
            ordinarily supplied by the command.  Ask for a heading also.

   FORK



|  Makes the specified fork your current fork.  The current fork  is  the
|  fork to which TOPS-20 commands are applied.


   Format


         FORK      fork|       @FORK (IS) fork
|  
|       where
|  
|       fork is one of the following:  Fork name

|       Default Fork
|  
|            If you do not specify a fork name or number  with  the  FORK
|            command,  the fork with the highest fork number (usually the
|            last fork created) becomes your current fork, and  the  fork
|            name is printed in brackets, [FORK-NAME].

|       More Information
|  
|            The FORK command is one of  the  TOPS-20  multiforking-class
|            commands.   For more information about multiforking, see the
                                                                  _______|            section named  Running  Multiple  Programs  in  the  TOPS-20

   Special Cases


        Fork 0

             If you are a user with enabled Wheel privileges you can give
             the  command, FORK 0.  This references the command processor
             (EXEC) itself.

        Other HELP Command Arguments

             Note that some of the HELP command arguments shown here  may
             be  omitted  if  the  associated topics are not available at
             your site.  The list may include  other  texts  inserted  by
             your  system  administrator  to describe features special to
             your system.  Also,  this  list  is  revised  frequently  to
             reflect  improvements  and  additions  to  standard  TOPS-20
             programs.


   Hints


        Printing HELP Files on the Line Printer

             The texts displayed by the HELP command are stored in system
             logical name HLP:  under the name of the topic and file type


                                    192



             .HLP.  Use the PRINT command to request your own copy.


   Effect on Memory and Terminal


        The HELP command does not affect memory and leaves your  terminal
        at TOPS-20 command level.


   Examples


        1.  Ask for information about the FILCOM  program,  and  truncate
            the output with CTRL/Cs.

            @HELP FILCOM
            FILCOM compares two files in either ASCII mode
            or binary depending upon switches or file name extensions.
            All standard binary extensions are recognized as binary by
             default.
            Switches are :-
            /A compare in ASCII mode
            /B allow compare of Blank lines
            /C ignore Comments and spacing
            /S ignore Spacing
            /H type this Help text
            /#L Lower limit for partial compare
                    or number of Lines to be matched
                    ( # represents an octal number)
            /#U Upper limit for part^C
            ^C
            @

        2.  Use the DIRECTORY command to search system logical name  HLP:
            for  any  text involving programming language APL.  (Note the
            use of wildcard characters here.)  Print copies of  one  such
            file for later use.

            @DIRECTORY HLP:*APL*.HLP


               PS:<HELP>

   Hints


|       Specifying the Current Fork of TOPS-20
|  
|            Use the FORK command to specify the fork to be described  by
|            the  ADDRESS-BREAK,  FILE-STATUS,  MEMORY-USAGE  and VERSION
|            arguments.  Find out  your  current  fork  with  INFORMATION
|            FORK-STATUS.


   Effect on Memory and Terminal

        The INFORMATION command does not affect memory  and  leaves  your
        terminal at TOPS-20 command level.


|  Related Commands

        4.  Place  a  program  in  memory  section  17.   Then  give  the
            INFORMATION  MEMORY-USAGE  command to verify that the program
            was appropriately placed.  The  page  numbers,  beginning  at
            17000,  indicate that section 17 is in use, because a section
            comprises 1000 (octal) pages.  Also, the  left  half  of  the

|       Characteristics of Kept Forks
|  
|            The KEEP command gives a fork a "kept" status.  A kept  fork
|            has these characteristics:
|  
|             o  A kept fork is not reset when another program is brought
|                into  memory.   Normally,  when  a  program  is  run, it
|                replaces or  "resets"  the  fork  currently  in  memory.
|                However,  if the program in memory is in a kept fork and
|                a new program is run, the new program is placed in a new
|                fork.  This allows you to have several forks in memory.
|  
|             o  A kept fork is not cleared from memory  with  the  RESET
|                command  unless  the  fork  is  explicitly named, or the
|                asterisk (*) or period (.) argument used.
|  
|             o  A kept fork can be restarted by  typing  the  kept  fork
|                name  as  an  EXEC  command.   The kept fork name can be
|                abbreviated to the point where it is  unique  from  EXEC
|                commands  and other kept fork names.  ESCAPE recognition
|                and question mark help  also  function  with  kept  fork
|                names.
|  
|                The KEEP command sets the kept fork to  restart  at  its
|                starting  address  when the kept fork name is given as a
|                command.  For information on changing the fork's restart
|                address  see  Hints,  Setting  the  Kept  Fork's Restart
|                Address.

|            Any inferior forks created by a kept fork are also kept.
|  
|  
|  Restrictions
|  
|  
|       Limited Number of Forks
|  
|            There is a limited number of forks available  on  a  system.
|            When  all  forks are in use, existing users cannot add forks
|            and new users cannot log in.  Therefore, KEEP only necessary
|            forks and return idle forks to the system with the UNKEEP or
|            RESET commands.
|  
|  
|  Hints
|  
|  
|       Keeping Forks Automatically
|  
|            Place  SET  PROGRAM  KEEP  commands  in  your  LOGIN.CMD  or
|            COMAND.CMD file for programs that you normally place in kept
|            forks.   Then  when  you  load  the  program,   the   system
|            automatically  keeps  the  fork  and  notifies  you with the
|            message [Keeping FORK-NAME].
|  
|            The SET PROGRAM command applies only the current EXEC level.
|            If  you want your SET PROGRAM commands to be in effect after
|            a PUSH command, put the commands into your COMAND.CMD  file.
|            The  COMAND.CMD  file  is executed automatically after every
|            PUSH command.
|  
|  
|       Kept Forks Continued Using the Fork Name
|  
|            The KEEP command sets  the  fork  to  be  restarted  at  its
|            starting  point  when  the  fork name is given as a command.
|            So, if a program that was kept  with  the  KEEP  command  is
|            running  in  a  background  fork, and you type the kept fork
|            name, execution of the program is canceled and  the  program
|            returns to its start address, which is usually the program's
|            prompt.
|  
|            The SET PROGRAM KEEP command allows you to specify the point
|            at  which  the fork will restart when the fork name is given
|            as a command.  The  starting  point  can  be  the  program's
|            continue,  reentry,  or  start  address.   The  command  SET
|            PROGRAM KEEP CONTINUE gives the fork name the same  function
|            as  the  CONTINUE  /NORMALLY command.  So, if a program that
|            was kept with the  SET  PROGRAM  KEEP  CONTINUE  command  is
|            running  in  a  background  fork, and you type the kept fork
|            name, execution of the program continues and  your  terminal


                                    217



|            is placed at program level.
|  
|  
|       More Information
|  
|            The KEEP command is one of  the  TOPS-20  multiforking-class
|            commands.   For more information about multiforking, see the
                                                                  _______|            section named  Running  Multiple  Programs  in  the  TOPS-20

|  
|  Effect on Memory and Terminal

   LOAD



   Loads your program into memory, compiling the  source  file  first  if
   necessary.


   Format

         LOAD        /switch(es) source/switch(es) object,...        @LOAD (FROM) /switch(es) source/switch(es) object,...

        switches       are  keywords  chosen   from   the   list   below,
                       indicating  your  choice  of LOAD command options.
                       They have different  effects  depending  on  their
                       position  in  the command line:  placed before all
                       files in the command, they  act  as  defaults  for
                       all;   otherwise  they  affect  only  the  nearest
                       preceding file.
                            Defaults                            Defaults are shown in the list of switches

        source         is the file specification of the  source  program.
                       The filename must be of 6 or fewer characters, and
                       the file type of 3 or fewer characters; you cannot
                       use  a  generation  number.   This argument is not
                       necessary if you supply an object filespec.

        object         is the file specification of the  object  program.
                       The filename must be of 6 or fewer characters, and
                       the file type must  be  .REL;  you  cannot  use  a
                       generation number.  This argument is not necessary
                       if you supply a source filespec.
                            Default                            Default (if  you  give  neither  source   nor

        /LIST             prints a line printer listing of the program in
                          ASCII
                          format.  The name of this listing is the
                          filename of the object file. The /CREF switch
                          overrides

|       /MAC              same as /MACRO.
|  
|       /MACHINE-CODE     produces a file containing the generated

   Characteristics

        Compiling New Sources Only

             Before loading programs, the system ordinarily compiles any
             specified source
             (and only those sources)
             whose write date is more recent than that of the object file
             of the
             same name. You can override this action with the /COMPILE
             or /RELOCATABLE switch.


        Using Standard File Types

             If you specify source files with standard types (.FOR, .MAC,
             .CBL,
             or .ALG) in a LOAD command, the system automatically calls
             the
             appropriate compiler when compilation is necessary. If you
             specify source files
             by filename only, the system searches your connected
             directory for
             a file of this name and a standard type. To load programs
             from
             sources that have nonstandard file types, give a switch to
             indicate the proper
             compiler (/FORTRAN, /MACRO, /COBOL, or /ALGOL). A switch
             will
             take precedence over a standard file type if they indicate
             different languages.
             If no compiler is indicated with either a switch or a
             standard
             file type, the FORTRAN compiler is used.




                                    226



|       Default Switches Not Passed to Compiler
|  
|            Only switches specified in a LOAD-class command are passed
|            to the compiler;
|            default switches are not passed. Instead, the system assumes
|            that the 
|            defaults for the compiler are the same as the defaults for
|            the
|            LOAD-class command.


   Hints


        Commas Between Filespecs

             If you give two or more filespecs separated by commas as
             arguments to LOAD, the loaded programs exist in memory
             at the same time and will operate as a single program. You
             can use
             this feature to substitute one module for another under
             varying conditions
             or for different applications.

        Plus Signs Between Filespecs

             If you give two or more source filespecs separated by plus
             signs (+)
             as arguments to LOAD, they are compiled together as if they
             were
             a single file. Their object module is stored under any
             filename
             given as the "object" argument of the command, or (if none)
             under the last
             filename in the group and file type .REL.

        Indirect Files as Arguments

             You can store arguments (source and object filespecs,
             switches)
             of a LOAD command in an indirect file, and specify them by
             typing an
             at sign (@) and its filespec as a LOAD command argument.

        Establishing Default Arguments with the SET Command

             You can issue the SET DEFAULT COMPILE-SWITCHES command to
             set up
             default global arguments to the LOAD command. Insert this
             SET
             command in your COMAND.CMD file to change your own defaults
             permanently.


                                    227



        Running Link Directly

             The LOAD command automatically runs LINK, the system's
|            linking loader,
             but if you require more control of the loading process you
             can
                                        _______ ____ _________ ______             run LINK directly. See the TOPS-20 LINK Reference Manual.


        Using GET Instead of LOAD

             If you have used the SAVE command to save your programs in
             executable format, you can use the GET command instead of
             LOAD
             to place them in memory.  This is a faster and less
             expensive means
             of loading programs into memory.


   Restrictions

        Switches Requiring Compilation

             /CREF

             /NOOPTIMIZE
             /OPTIMIZE

             The above switches will not  take  effect  unless  the  LOAD
             command  causes  a  new  compilation  of the relevant source
             file.  See  Characteristics - Compiling  New  Sources  Only,
             above, for more information.

|       Wildcards Illegal with LOAD
|  
|            The LOAD command does not accept wildcard characters (*  and
|            %) in a file specification.

   Warning - Generation Numbers, Long Filespecs

        You must not give generation numbers when  specifying  source  or
        object   files;   the   system  automatically  uses  the  highest
        generation.  Also, most compilers require filenames of 6 or fewer
        characters and file types of 3 or fewer characters.


   Effect on Memory and Terminal



                                    228



        The LOAD command clears memory and loads your program.  It leaves
        your terminal at TOPS-20 command level.

   LOGIN



   Begins your timesharing job and connects you to your log-in directory.


   Format

         LOGIN              name            pwd           acc                  remark|       @LOGIN /FAST (USER) name (PASSWORD) pwd (ACCOUNT) acc (SESSION REMARK) remark


        where

        name         is your user name

        pwd          is your secret password (which  is  not  printed  on
                     your terminal)

        acc          is an account name or number that you are authorized
                     to use

|       remark       is an optional remark of up to  39  characters  that
|                    identifies   the  terminal  session  for  accounting
|                    purposes.   Check   with   INFORMATION   JOB-STATUS.
|                    Change with SET SESSION-REMARK.
|  
|       /FAST        is an optional switch that prevents  the  following:
|                    processing  of  your  LOGIN.CMD and COMAND.CMD files
*                    and the system's  LOGIN.CMD  and  COMAND.CMD  files,
                     printing  of system mail, and printing of the notice
                     of new mail.  (Your system manager may  remove  this
                     switch from your system.)


   Output

|       Acknowledgement of Valid Login
|  
|            The system acknowledges a valid LOGIN  command  by  printing
|            your  job  number, terminal number, and the current date and
|            time.  In addition, it prints the date and time of your last
|            login.  You can use this information to determine if another
|            user has learned your password and logged in to your account
|            since the last time you logged out.
|  
|            Note that a batch job automatically logs in and logs out  of
|            your  account.   The  batch  login sets the date and time of
|            your last login and should  not  be  confused  with  illegal
|            access to your account.




                                    232



|       Notice of User Mail and System Mail
|  
|            When you log in the system notifies you if another user  has
|            sent  you  a  message  with one of the system mail programs.
|            Then, it lists any system  mail  (mail  sent  by  privileged
|            users  to  all  users)  that has accumulated since your last
|            login.  Note that this mail appears in the  log  file  if  a
|            batch  job  is run for you between the time the mail is sent
|            and the time you logged in.
|  
|  
*       Output from Command Files
*  
*            After a successful LOGIN, the system processes the LOGIN.CMD
*            and  COMAND.CMD  files  in  your  login  directory  and  the
*            LOGIN.CMD and COMAND.CMD files in the directory  defined  by
*            SYS:.  The files are processed in this order:
*  
*            1.  LOGIN.CMD
*  
*            2.  SYS:LOGIN.CMD
*  
*            3.  COMAND.CMD
*  
*            4.  SYS:COMAND.CMD
*  
*            The system displays any output from the  commands  is  these
*            files  on  your  terminal.   Then,  after  execution of each
*            command file,  the  system  displays  the  message  "End  of
*            file-name.CMD."


   Characteristics

|       Typing an Initial CTRL/C or RETURN

             Before logging in you may have to type a  CTRL/C  or  RETURN
             (which  will print the system herald or greeting) to get the
             @ prompt necessary for typing the LOGIN command.

             If you are dialing  in  by  telephone  to  a  line  declared
             autobaud  by  the  system  manager, this initial CTRL/C or a
|            RETURN enables the system to determine your terminal's speed
|            setting,  as long as the speed is 110, 150, 300, 1200, 1800,
|            2400, 4800, or 9600.  Type a second CTRL/C or RETURN if  the
|            terminal's  speed  is 110 or 150.  Type only a single CTRL/C
|            if the speed is 4800.  If  your  initial  CTRL/C  or  RETURN
|            fails  to  get  the  system identification message, type the
|            BREAK key twice, followed by another CTRL/C or RETURN.


        Rights, Capabilities, and Charges


                                    233



             The LOGIN command gives you ownership rights to your  log-in
             directory,  and  any group rights established for you on the
             public structure (usually named PS:).  In addition, you  are
             granted  whatever  capabilities  (for  example, Maintenance,
             Wheel)  have been awarded to you, and can be sure  that  any
             charges  you  incur for the use of system resources, such as
             CPU time or the batch and printing systems, will  be  billed
             to your user name.


   Hints

        Commands in Files Executed at Log-in Time

             TERMINAL Commands

|                 If you  have  commands  in  your  LOGIN.CMD  file  that
|                 control terminal output (for example, TERMINAL PAUSE or
                  TERMINAL LENGTH), be sure to put them before the  first
                  command  that  runs  a  program.   Then they will be in
                  effect when system mail is displayed.

             For Affecting Entire Session or Current Level Only

                  Commands that affect  your  entire  job,  for  example,
                  TERMINAL  and  DEFINE,  belong  in LOGIN.CMD.  Commands
                  that affect only the  current  level  of  TOPS-20,  for
                  example, many SET commands, must be put into COMAND.CMD
                  if you want them to  be  executed  automatically  after
                  every PUSH command as well as after LOGIN.

             For Affecting Batch Jobs

                  As soon as one of your batch jobs logs in,  the  system
*                 processes  your login directory's command files and the
*                 system's command files.  The  files  are  processed  in
*                 this order:
*  
*                 1.  LOGIN.CMD
*  
*                 2.  SYS:LOGIN.CMD
*  
*                 3.  BATCH.CMD
*  
*                 4.  SYS:BATCH.CMD
*  
*                 5.  COMAND.CMD
*  
*                 6.  SYS:COMAND.CMD
|  
|                 Note that certain parameters  of  the  batch  job,  for
|                 example,  its  time limit and the name of its log file,


                                    234



|                 have  already  been  set  before  these  commands   are
|                 executed.   Such  parameters  are  set either to values
|                 specified by switches in the SUBMIT command that starts
|                 the  batch  job, or to default values in effect for the
|                 job issuing this SUBMIT command.  See also  Hints - For
|                 Affecting Nested Batch Jobs, below.
|  
|  
*            Avoiding Duplicate Commands in Command Files
*  
*                 After  execution  of  a  command  file  in  your  login
*                 directory,  the system executes the command file of the
*                 same name in the directory deined by  SYS:.   The  SYS:
*                 command  files  may  contain  commands that you already
*                 have in your own command files.  To avoid executing the
*                 same  commands  twice,  remove  duplicate commands from
*                 your command files.   To  display  a  system's  command
*                 files, give the command TYPE SYS:file-name.CMD.


             For Affecting Nested Batch Jobs

                  By placing a SET DEFAULT SUBMIT command in  a  file  of
                  specification  BATCH.CMD  in your log-in directory, you
|                 cause these defaults to be in effect for a nested batch
|                 job,  (a  batch  job started by a SUBMIT command within
|                 the control file of another of your batch jobs).

             A Final TAKE Command

                  To  suppress  the  display  of  the  message  "End   of
                  file-name.CMD"  after execution of a command file, make
                  the last command in the file a  TAKE  command  with  no
|                 arguments.   Be  sure the file contains only one RETURN
|                 after the TAKE command.

        Simplifying Log-ins

                  By using the SET DIRECTORY ACCOUNT-DEFAULT command  you
                  cause  subsequent  LOGIN  commands to require just your
                  user name and password.


   Special Cases


        Commands You Can Issue Before Log-in

|            You can give these commands and arguments before logging in:

             TERMINAL
             UNATTACH


        Logging in to PTYs

             You do not need to give a password  when  logging  in  under
             your own user name to a PTY (pseudo-terminal).

        Must Log In Within Five Minutes

             If you do not log in within five  minutes  of  your  initial
             CTRL/C,  your  job  will be logged out automatically and you
             will have to type CTRL/C again.

        Logging in to Last Available Job Slot

             If you attempt to log in to the last available job slot, the
             system  will  not  log  you  in  but  will send you an error
             message instead.  This job slot is intended  for  users  who
             wish  to  attach detached jobs using the ATTACH command.  To
             log in a new job you must wait until  a  current  user  logs
             out.


   Effect on Memory and Terminal


        The LOGIN command does not affect memory and leaves your terminal
        at  TOPS-20  command  level.   However, commands in command files
        executed during log-in (see Hints, above) will have  their  usual
        effect on memory and your terminal.

   Characteristics


        Expunging Your Log-in and Connected Directories

             Before logging you out,  the  system  expunges  any  deleted
             files from your log-in and connected directories, and prints
             a  message  if  either  directory  is  still  exceeding  its


                                    238



             assigned permanent disk quota.

        Logging Out Other Jobs

             By specifying a job number you can log  out  any  other  job
|            logged  in under the same user name as your attached job.  A
|            user with Wheel or Operator capabilities enabled can log out
|            any  job  on  the system.  Whenever you log out another job,
|            the system prints the job's user name, terminal number,  and
|            current  program.   You must then confirm the LOGOUT command
|            with an extra RETURN.

*            command in the file a TAKE command with  no  arguments.   Be
*            sure  the  file  contains  only  one  RETURN  after the TAKE
*            command.


*       Errors in LOGOUT.CMD
*  
*            If there is an error in a command in your  LOGOUT.CMD  file,
*            the system processes the commands up to the one in error and
*            cancels the LOGOUT command.  To log out, correct  the  error
*            in  the  command  file  or  give the LOGOUT command with the
*            /FAST switch.

        Effect on Memory and Terminal


             The LOGOUT command clears memory and leaves your terminal in
             the  state  before  log-in.  LOGOUT n does not affect memory
             and leaves your terminal at TOPS-20 command level.

   MERGE



   Places an executable program into the current fork, combining it  with
   whatever program (if any) is already there.


   Format


         MERGE           filespec /switch|       @MERGE (PROGRAM) filespec /switch

        where

        filespec     is the file specification of any executable program
                          Default                          Default file type - .EXE

        /switch      is one or more of the following:

|                         /OVERLAY       loads pages of the  new  program
|                                        over   pages   occupied  by  the
|                                        existing program in memory.

                          /USE-SECTION:n
                                         specifies  the  memory   section
                                         (from  0 to 37 octal) into which
                                         your program is  to  be  merged.
                                         You  can use this switch only if
                                         your program can be contained in
                                         one section.


   Characteristics


        Executable Files Only

             If a program you try to merge is not in  executable  format,
             you   may   get   an   immediate  error  message  (that  is,
             "?UNEXPECTED END-OF-FILE TRAP...") or a  delayed  one  (that
             is,  "?ENTRY VECTOR LENGTH IS NOT LESS THAN 1000") after the
             merge.  In either case, be sure that you have  specified  an
             executable  program before investigating further.  The MERGE
             command does not alter the entry vector if  the  file  being
             merged is in the proper .EXE format.

|       Existing Pages Not Overlaid
|  
|            If there is a program already in memory when  you  give  the
|            MERGE  command, and pages of the new program overlay it, the
|            new program is not placed into memory, and the system prints


                                    241



|            the  error message, "?Illegal to overlay existing pages." To
|            force the existing pages to be overlaid, reissue  the  MERGE
|            command using the /OVERLAY switch.


|  Effect on Memory on Terminal
|  
|       The MERGE command combines the specified program with the program
|       in  the  current  fork.   It  does not affect the contents of the
|       current fork unless  you  specify  the  /OVERLAY  switch.   MERGE
|       leaves your terminal at TOPS-20 command level.

   Characteristics


        MODIFY Effective Only Before Processing

             The MODIFY command affects a batch or  output  request  only


                                    252



             before  processing  has  begun.  After processing has begun,
             you can only cancel the request with the CANCEL command, and
             then make a new request.


   Hints


        Using the /DEPENDENCY-COUNT Switch

             You can use the  /DEPENDENCY-COUNT  switch  to  specify  the
             order  in  which  your  batch  jobs  are processed.  Set the
             dependency count of all but the first job to  some  positive
             value  when  you submit them, and include MODIFY commands in
             each job's control file to bring the next  job's  dependency
             count to 0 at the appropriate time.  See Example 4.


   Special Cases


        /JOBNAME Switch

             In the singular case when you want to modify  several  queue
             requests  of  the  same  jobname using only one command, and
             that jobname is purely numerical (e.g., 5045), you must  use
             the /JOBNAME:jobname switch as second argument to the MODIFY
             command.  Do not also give the request ID or  jobname  as  a
             command argument if you give the /JOBNAME:jobname switch.


   Effect on Memory and Terminal


        The MODIFY  command  does  not  affect  memory  and  leaves  your
        terminal at TOPS-20 command level.

   MOUNT



   Requests that a specified file structure or magnetic tape set be  made
   available for your job's use.


   Format


         MOUNT medium        dev:  /switch(es)        @MOUNT medium (NAME) dev:  /switch(es)

        where

        medium                   is one of the following:


                                     STRUCTURE - for    mounting     file
                                                 structures (disk packs)

                                                 tapes

        dev:                     is either the  structure  identification
*                                (or  alias),  or  the tape setname.  The
*                                colon after the device name is optional.

        /switches                are  keywords,  chosen  from  the   list

   /PROTECTION:code                   specifies    a    6-digit     octal
                                      protection  code for new volumes of
                                      tape  written  during  the  current
                                      mount  request.   The  owner always
                                      has full access to  his  tapes,  so
                                      the  first  two  digits  are always
                                      interpreted  as  "77";  also,  user
                                      groups and directory groups have no
                                      effect  on  tape  access,  so   the
                                      middle   two   digits   are  always
                                      interpreted  as  "00".   Therefore,
                                      although    six   digits   can   be
                                      specified, only the last two digits
                                      affect the tape's protection code.

                                      (If you specify  only  two  digits,
                                      these  will be used as the last two
                                      digits  of  the  protection  code.)
                                      These  two digits should be the sum
                                      of the values corresponding to  the

                                      will be  drawn  from  the  pool  of
                                      scratch  tapes (tapes not presently
                                      owned by a particular user), rather
                                      than from volumes you specify.  Use
                                      this switch to create  a  new  file
                                      set  when you are not supplying the
                                      volumes of tape to be used.

          NUMBER number
   /START:VOLID volid                 tells  the  system   which   volume
                                      (reel)  of tape to mount first when
                                      satisfying your request.  (You must
                                      also   give   the  /VOLIDS  switch,
                                      specifying the group of volumes you
                                      will  be  using.)  Use  the  NUMBER
                                      argument to give the order of  this
                                      volume  within  the  group (e.g., 1
                                      for first, 2 for second),  or  give
                                      the  VOLID  argument  to repeat the
                                      volid explicitly.  You can use this
                                      switch  to  save  time  and expense
                                      when you know which volume you will

                                      of tape you want to access.   These
                                      must    be   consecutive   volumes,

   Characteristics


        Action of MOUNT STRUCTURE Command

             If the Structure Has Already Been Mounted

                  If the structure for which you give the  MOUNT  command
                  is  currently mounted, the system simply increases by 1
                  the mount count, i.e., the number  of  users  who  have
                  given  the  MOUNT  but not the DISMOUNT command for the
                  structure, and returns your terminal to TOPS-20 command
                  level.   A structure is not ordinarily dismounted until
                  its mount count is 0.

             If the Structure Has Not Yet Been Mounted

                  If the structure for which you give the  MOUNT  command
                  is  not  currently  mounted,  your request stays in the
                  mount request queue until  it  is  acted  upon  by  the
                  operator or until you cancel the request.

        Setnames (File Set Identifiers)

             The setname, or file set identifier of a set  of  tapes,  is
             part  of  the  label information written into each volume of
             the set.  It is rewritten every time the  /NEW  or  /SCRATCH
             switch  is included in a MOUNT command.  The "dev:" argument
             of the MOUNT command becomes the setname in this  case.   If
             you add volumes to an existing tape set, the system uses the
             setname of the old volumes as the setname of the new ones.

             Using the /CHECK-SETNAME Switch

                  If you give the MOUNT command to use an  existing  file
                  set  (i.e.,  you  do  not  specify the /NEW or /SCRATCH
                  switch), you can give the /CHECK-SETNAME switch  to  be
                  sure  that the setname written on the tapes matches the
                  setname you specify as the "dev:" argument to the MOUNT
                  command.   However,  because more than one set of tapes


                                    261



                  can have the same setname,  the  /CHECK-SETNAME  switch
                  does  not  ensure  that  the  correct  tape set will be
                  mounted.   For  information  about  ensuring  that  the
                  correct  tapes are mounted, see Characteristics - Using
                  the /VOLIDS Switch, below.

        Volids (Volume Identifiers)

             The volid, or  volume  identifier  of  a  volume  (reel)  of
             labeled  tape, is part of the label information written into
             each volume of tape.   It  is  written  only  once,  by  the
             operator  during the tape's initialization procedure, and is
             not changed during the life of the tape.  (You  should  also
             affix  a  paper label displaying the volid onto each reel of
             tape.) You can get a list of volids for previously specified
             or  newly  written volumes in any mounted tape set by giving
             the INFORMATION VOLUMES command for that set.


             Using the /VOLIDS Switch

                  If you give  the  MOUNT  command  to  use  an  existing
                  multi-volume  tape  set  (i.e.,  you do not specify the
                  /SCRATCH switch), you can give the volid of each volume
                  you  want  to use as an argument to the /VOLIDS switch.
                  The system  ensures  that  the  correct  volumes  of  a
                  labeled  tape  will  be mounted for your job as long as
                  you use the /VOLIDS switch to specify  them.   (If  the
                  tape  set does not consist of labeled tapes, the system
                  does not ensure that the correct  tapes  are  mounted.)
                  The  volids must represent consecutive volumes and must
                  be specified in the order written (oldest first).  Note
                  that  in  general  you  cannot  rely  on  any  apparent
                  alphanumerical order when  specifying  the  volids  but
                  must  maintain your own list of the volids in each tape
                  set.  (See Hints - Keeping Track of Volids, below.) You
                  need not specify every volid in the tape set,  but any
                  volume not specified will not be accessible through the
                  current  MOUNT  command.   See  also  Characteristics -
                  Using   the   /OPERATOR  Switch,  and  Special  Cases -
                  Single-volume Tape Sets, below.

             Using the /OPERATOR Switch

                  You can use the /OPERATOR switch instead of the /VOLIDS
                  switch  when  asking the system to mount a multi-volume
                  set of tapes.  The /OPERATOR switch sends a message  to
                  the  operator  asking  him to specify the volid of each
                  volume  himself.   You  must  be  sure  to  supply  the
                  operator  with  a  list  of  the volids you want him to
                  specify before giving a MOUNT command that contains the
                  /OPERATOR switch.


                                    262



   Hints


        Checking Whether Operator is Present

             You can give the INFORMATION SYSTEM-STATUS command  to  find
             out  whether  the  operator is in attendance and can process
             your  mount  request.   Even  if  the  operator  is  not  in
             attendance,  your request remains valid until he returns and
             deals with it in some way.

        Using the /STRUCTURE-ID Switch

             The /STRUCTURE-ID  switch  (available  only  to  users  with
             enabled  Wheel  or  Operator capabilities) gives the name of
             the structure as recorded in the disk(s)  of  the  structure
             itself,  where  it is used by the system for identification.
             Be sure that the structure identification  is  also  written
             with  a  felt-tip  marker  on the upper surface of each disk
             pack, and on a gummed label on the pack cover.   Unless  you
             give  this  switch, the system mounts the structure with its
             structure identification as alias.  (The alias is  the  name
             you use when specifying the structure in file specifications
             and commands;  the  INFORMATION  STRUCTURE  and  INFORMATION
             AVAILABLE  DEVICES  commands list structures by alias only.)
             The /STRUCTURE-ID switch allows an enabled Wheel or Operator
             to  mount  a  structure  under a name different from the one
             recorded in the structure.  Use this switch for  mounting  a
             structure  whose structure identification is the same as the
             alias of a currently mounted structure.  In such cases  give
             the  MOUNT  STRUCTURE  command  with any unique alias as the
             "dev:" argument, and specify  the  structure  identification
             with   the   /STRUCTURE-ID   switch.    In  subsequent  file
             specifications and commands referring to the structure,  use
             the alias only.

        Dummy "dev:" Arguments for Mounting Tapes

             If you  want  to  use  different  tape  sets  on  successive
             runnings  of  a  single program, you can refer to those tape
             sets as a logical name in the program, and use this  logical
             name  as  the  "dev:"  argument  of  your MOUNT command when
             mounting tapes.  As long as you also specify  the  volid  of
             each  volume  of  tape  with  the /VOLIDS switch (or use the
             /OPERATOR switch to ask the operator to do so), you need not
             give  the  actual  setname  of  the  tape  set as the "dev:"
             argument to the MOUNT command.   The  system  considers  the
             "dev:"  argument  you supply to be a logical name defined as
             the mounted tape set.  Therefore, your  program  can  access
             the tape set using this logical name.

        Keeping Track of Volids


                                    263



             Unless your site has a tape cataloging  facility,  you  must
             keep  your  own  record  of  the volids in each of your tape
             sets.  After creating a file set on a new tape set, i.e, one
             not previously owned by you (by giving the MOUNT command and
             including  the  /SCRATCH  switch),  you  should   give   the
             INFORMATION  VOLUMES  command  for the set before giving the
             DISMOUNT command.  The system will  respond  by  printing  a
             list  at  your  terminal of the volids of all volumes in the
             tape set.  Similarly, if you mount an old tape set and  then
             perform   write  operations,  you  should  give  INFORMATION
             VOLUMES before giving DISMOUNT to learn the  volids  of  any
             volumes  added  to  the  set.  Keep an ordered list of these
             volids in  a  disk  file  in  your  directory,  for  use  in
             subsequent MOUNT commands when you give the /VOLIDS switch.


   Special Cases


        Single-volume Tape Sets

             If the tape set you want  to  mount  consists  of  a  single
             volume  of  tape, you need not give the /VOLIDS or /OPERATOR
             switch to specify its volid.  You can give the volid as  the
             "dev:" argument to the MOUNT command.


        Structures Unavailable for Mounting

             If the operator has  given  the  OPR  program  command,  SET
             STRUCTURE  UNAVAILABLE for a specified structure, the system
             sends an error  message  including  the  phrase,  "Structure
             unavailable  for  mounting"  in response to subsequent MOUNT
             commands for the structure.

             The TOPS-20 SET TAPE DENSITY and SET  TAPE  PARITY  commands
             are  applicable  to  unlabeled  tapes  only  (but  see  also
             Warnings - /DENSITY Switch Has Limited Effect for  Unlabeled
             Tapes,   below).    The   SET   TAPE  FORMAT  and  SET  TAPE
             RECORD-LENGTH commands are applicable to  both  labeled  and
             unlabeled  tapes,  but  to  labeled  tapes  only if they are
             mounted using the  /LABEL-TYPE:ANSI  or  /LABEL-TYPE:TOPS-20
             switch.   In addition, the files that you read from or write
             to such a labeled tape must be in 36-bit  format,  and  they
             must  not  have  the  ;FORMAT  attribute  as  part  of their
             specification.

   Warnings


        POP Command Cancels Unsatisfied Mount Requests

             If you have given a PUSH command to obtain a  new  level  of
             TOPS-20 and then give a MOUNT command within that new level,
             a subsequent POP command will  cancel  your  mount  request.
             However,  if the specified structure or tape set has already
             been mounted,  it  will  remain  mounted  despite  your  POP
             command.

        /DENSITY Switch Has Limited Effect for Unlabeled Tapes

             The /DENSITY switch, when given in a MOUNT  command  for  an
             unlabeled  tape,  ensures  only  that  your tape set will be
             mounted on a drive that supports the specified density.   It
             does not ensure that the tape set will be read or written at
             this density.  To specify the  density  at  which  unlabeled
             tapes  are to be read and written, give the SET TAPE DENSITY
             command.


   Effect on Memory and Terminal


        The MOUNT command does  not  affect  memory,  and,  if  you  have
        included  the  /NOWAIT  switch,  leaves  your terminal at TOPS-20
        command level.  If you have not given the  /NOWAIT  switch,  your
        terminal  waits  until  the system has processed your request, or
        until you give a CTRL/C to return to TOPS-20 command level.  This
        CTRL/C does not cancel your request.

   Examples


        1.  Mount a structure (it is already physically mounted).

            @MOUNT STRUCTURE SNARK:
            Structure SNARK: mounted
            @

        2.  Mount a structure that is not yet physically mounted.   After
            completing  the  command,  give  CTRL/Cs to return to TOPS-20
            command level.

            @MOUNT STRUCTURE PYBL:
            [Mount Request PYBL Queued, Request-ID 205]
            [MOUNT request remaining in queue]
            ^C
            @

        3.  Mount a structure, then give CTRL/Cs  to  return  to  TOPS-20
            command level and cancel the mount request.

            @MOUNT STRUCTURE PYBL:
            [Mount Request PYBL Queued, Request-ID 136]
            [MOUNT request remaining in queue]

        4.  Find out what structures are available  for  mounting  (these
            are  listed  after  DSK and PS and before the line printers),
            and mount one of these.

            been mounted (it has not), then mount it yourself.  Note that
            you must first enable Wheel or Operator capabilities to mount
            this  pack,  because its structure identification is PS:  and
            you must therefore mount it under a different alias.

            Once the structure is mounted,  access  a  directory  on  the
            structure   to  obtain  group  rights,  then  find  out  what
            directories and files are on the structure.

            simplify  volume  changes)  and  overwrite any existing files
            with new files.  Then rewind  the  tape  set.   Give  various

            call  the  OPR  program,  then  give the PUSH command to OPR.
            (This action puts you at TOPS-20 command  level,  but  allows
            you  also  to  see  the  OPR  messages caused by your TOPS-20
            commands.)  Repeat  the  write  operations  of  the  previous
            example,  then  dismount  the  tape set and exit from the OPR
            program.  Notice that, because of  the  /NOUNLOAD  switch  in
            your  original  MOUNT  command, both volumes of your tape set
            remain mounted on their drives.  Therefore, you can mount the
            tapes again without operator assistance.

                            Defaults|                           Defaults are shown in the list of switches

                            Default|                           Default - the  last  file  specification  and
|                                     associated  switches  you gave in a
|                                     CREATE,  EDIT,  or  PERUSE  command
|                                     during the current terminal session
|  
|  
|  Characteristics
|  
|  
|       The PERUSE command runs the  EDIT  system  program  in  read-only
|       mode.   (However,  see Special Cases - Using an Editor Other than
|       EDIT, below.) PERUSE is actually the same as the  EDIT  /READONLY
|       command.   In  EDIT  /READONLY mode you can use only EDIT program
|       switches and commands that do not modify the file.
|  
|  
|  Hints
|  
|  
|       Avoid Accidental File Modification
|  
|            Use PERUSE when  it  is  important  to  avoid  the  risk  of
|            accidentally modifying a file.
|  
|  
|       PERUSE Line in SWITCH.INI
|  
|            Add a line to your SWITCH.INI file for use with  the  PERUSE
|            command.  (See Example 3.)
|  
|  
|  Special Cases




                                    274



|       Using an Editor Other than EDIT
|  
|            The CREATE, EDIT and PERUSE commands in this  manual  assume
|            that  these  commands call on the program EDIT.  If your job
|            uses another editing program, for example, EDT, the switches
|            and examples shown here will not be applicable.
|  
|            The Editor used by the CREATE, EDIT and PERUSE  commands  is
|            specified by the logical name EDITOR:.  You can find out the
|            name of this program  by  giving  the  command,  INFORMATION
|            LOGICAL-NAMES  EDITOR:.   The  job-wide  definition (if any)
|            will be given first, followed by the system-wide definition;
|            the  job-wide  definition  prevails  if  both exist.  If the
|            definition of EDITOR:  is SYS:EDIT.EXE, the CREATE, EDIT and
|            PERUSE  commands  will function as described in this manual.
|            Otherwise, you must  consult  the  appropriate  manual  (for
                          _____ _________ ______|            example, the EDT20 Reference Manual) for information.

|  Restrictions
|  
|  
|       Listing Available EDIT Read-Only Switches and Commands
|  
|            Many of the EDIT switches and commands that are displayed in
|            response  to  a  ?, modify the file and do not function with
|            PERUSE.  If you give a file-modifying switch, the switch  is
|            ignored  and  no  error message is displayed.  If you give a
|            file-modifying  EDIT  command,  you  receive   the   message
|            %ILLEGAL COMMAND.
|  
|            For further information on these switches and  commands  see
                 ____ _________ ______|            the EDIT Reference Manual.
|  
|  
|  Effect on Memory and Terminal
|  
|  
|       The PERUSE command clears any  unkept  forks  from  memory,  then
|       loads  your  edit  program  and  leaves  your  terminal at editor
|       command level.
|  
|  
|  Related Commands
|  
|  
|       CREATE                        for creating new files

        where

        switches       are  keywords,  chosen  from   the   list   below,
                       indicating  your  choice  of PLOT command options.
                       These switches are of two kinds:  job switches and
                       file switches.

                       Job switches apply to all files specified  in  the
                       command, no matter where you give the switches.

                       File switches have different effects depending  on
                       their  positions  in  the  command  line:   placed
                       before all files  in  the  command,  they  act  as
                       defaults  for  all; otherwise they affect only the
                       nearest preceding file.
                            Defaults                            Defaults are shown in the list of switches

        filespec       is the specification of a file you wish  to  plot.
                       You  can  use  wildcard  characters  (%  and *) to
                       specify more than one file.

        ,...           means that, after  a  comma,  you  can  give  more

                                      may be preceded by a plus sign (+),
                                      which  will delay processing by the

   Output


        Jobname, Request ID, Limit, Number of Input Files

             As soon as you complete a valid  PLOT  command,  the  system
             responds by printing, on your terminal, the jobname, request
             ID number, the limit in minutes of plotter time assigned  to
             the request, and the number of input files in the request.


   Characteristics



                                    282



        Ordinary Operation - No Switches

             For most purposes you can use the PLOT command with  just  a
             series of filespecs for arguments.

        Switch Defaults Set by System Manager

             The defaults shown in the list of switches are  correct  for
             most  user  sites.   However, your system manager can change
             some of those default settings.  The switches most  commonly
             affected  are:   /FORMS,  /HEADER and /NOHEADER, /LIMIT, and
             /PRIORITY.


   Hints


        Using SET DEFAULT PLOT

             If there are switches that you always or usually supply when
             using  PLOT,  give the SET DEFAULT PLOT command to establish
             them as defaults (at the current TOPS-20 command level)  for
             the  remainder  of your terminal session.  The switches will
             then behave as if you had  typed  them  directly  after  the
             command  name.   You  can  supersede  any  of  these default
             switches by actually  supplying  the  switch,  with  another
             value, when you give the PLOT command.  Put SET DEFAULT PLOT
             into a file  of  specification  COMAND.CMD  in  your  log-in
             directory if you want these default switches to be in effect
             for all levels of future terminal sessions as well.


   Special Cases


        /SPOOLED-OUTPUT Switch

             You can give the special switch,  /SPOOLED-OUTPUT,  as  sole
             argument  to  the  PLOT  command.   This  causes any spooled
             output accumulated so far during your terminal session to be
             placed  in  a  plotter  queue  immediately,  rather  than at
             log-out time.  The /SPOOLED-OUTPUT switch is useful only  if
             the  SET  SPOOLED-OUTPUT  DEFERRED  command  is  in  effect.
             Programs that you  run  (especially  FORTRAN  programs)  may
             create  spooled output for the plotter, or you can create it
             directly by giving the command, COPY filespec PLT:.


   Effect on Memory and Terminal


        The PLOT command does not affect memory and leaves your  terminal


                                    283



        at TOPS-20 command level.

   POP



   Terminates the current  level  of  TOPS-20  and  returns  you  to  its
   superior process.


   Format


         POP        @POP (COMMAND LEVEL)


   Characteristics


        POP the Opposite of PUSH

             You can do one and only one POP command for  every  previous
             PUSH  command.   Giving  too many POP commands will cause an
             error message to be printed on your terminal.

        Job Parameters Affected by POP

             As soon as you complete a valid POP command at some level of
             TOPS-20,  you  give  up the copy of memory for that level of
             TOPS-20 and any program  you  were  running.   Any  defaults
             established  at  that  level  (e.g.,  default  filespecs for
             LOAD-class and EDIT-class commands,  defaults  specified  by
             SET DEFAULT commands) are cancelled as well.  If POP returns
             you to a higher  level  of  TOPS-20,  all  these  parameters
             revert to any values established at that higher level.


   Special Cases


        Returning to Other Programs With POP

             The POP command usually returns you to the level of  TOPS-20
             from  which  you  gave  a  previous PUSH command.  But a few
             system programs, e.g., PTYCON and OPR,  also  allow  you  to
             give  PUSH  to  get  a new level of TOPS-20.  Giving the POP
             command to  this  level  of  TOPS-20  returns  you  to  that
             program.


   Effect on Memory and Terminal


        The POP command clears memory, terminates the  current  level  of


                                    285



        TOPS-20,  and  returns  your  terminal  to  the  previous TOPS-20
        command level (but see Special Cases,  above).   Memory  for  the
        previous TOPS-20 command level is not affected by this action.


   Related Commands


        CONTINUE     for resuming execution of a program in memory

        PUSH         for obtaining a new level of TOPS-20



   Examples


        1.  Give the POP command to return  to  a  higher  level  of  the
            TOPS-20 command processor (EXEC).

            @POP
            @

        2.  Run a program and halt it with CTRL/Cs.  Give a CONTINUE STAY
            command  to  resume  its execution, and then the PUSH command
            for a new level of TOPS-20.   Run  another  program  at  this
            lower  level, then use the POP command to return to the first
            level; in this case you return  before  receiving  the  final
            message of the first program.

            @RUN DMN

   PRINT



   Places requests in a line printer output queue.


   Format


         PRINT         /switch(es) filespec/switch(es),...        @PRINT (FILES) /switch(es) filespec/switch(es),...

        where

        switches     are keywords, chosen from the list below, indicating
                     your   choice   of  PRINT  command  options.   These
                     switches are of two kinds:  job  switches  and  file
                     switches.

                     Job switches apply to all  files  specified  in  the
                     command, no matter where you give the switches.

                     File switches have different  effects  depending  on
                     their  positions in the command file:  placed before
                     all files in the command, they act as  defaults  for
                     all;   otherwise   they   affect  only  the  nearest
                     preceding file.
                          Defaults                          Defaults are shown in the list of switches

        filespec     is the specification of a file you  wish  to  print.
                     You can use wildcard characters (% and *) to specify
                     more than one file.

        ,...         means  that,  after  a  comma,  you  can  give  more
                     arguments of the form already shown

   Output


        Jobname, Request ID, Limit, Number of Files

             As soon as you complete a valid PRINT  command,  the  system
             responds by printing, on your terminal, the jobname, request
             ID number, the limit in pages  of  output  assigned  to  the
             request, and the number of files in the request.


   Characteristics


        Ordinary Operation - No Switches

             For most purposes you can use the PRINT command with just  a
             series of filespecs for arguments.

        Switch Defaults Set by System Manager

             The defaults shown in the list of switches are  correct  for
             most  user  sites.   However, your system manager can change
             some of those default settings.  The switches most  commonly
             affected  are:   /FORMS,  /HEADER and /NOHEADER, /LIMIT, and
             /PRIORITY.


   Hints


        Using SET DEFAULT PRINT

             If there are switches that you always or usually supply when
             using PRINT, give the SET DEFAULT PRINT command to establish
             them as defaults (at the current TOPS-20 command level)  for
             the  remainder  of your terminal session.  The switches will
             then behave as if you had  typed  them  directly  after  the


                                    293



             command  name.   You  can  supersede  any  of  these default
             switches by actually  supplying  the  switch,  with  another
             value,  when  you  give  the PRINT command.  Put SET DEFAULT
             PRINT into a file of specification COMAND.CMD in your log-in
             directory if you want these default switches to be in effect
             for all levels of future terminal sessions as well.


   Special Cases


        /SPOOLED-OUTPUT Switch

             You can give the special switch,  /SPOOLED-OUTPUT,  as  sole
             argument  to  the  PRINT  command.   This causes any spooled
             output accumulated so far during your terminal session to be
             placed  in  a line printer queue immediately, rather than at
             log-out time.  The /SPOOLED-OUTPUT switch is useful only  if
             the  SET  SPOOLED-OUTPUT  DEFERRED  command  is  in  effect.
             Programs that you  run  (especially  FORTRAN  programs)  may
             create  spooled output for the printer, or you can create it
             directly by writing to device LPT:   (e.g.,  by  giving  the
             command, COPY filespec LPT:), or giving a CREF command.


   Effect on Memory and Terminal


        The PRINT command does not affect memory and leaves your terminal
        at TOPS-20 command level.

        1.  Print two of your files.

            @PRINT 4-UPED.TXT, CMPTN.TXT
            [Printer job 4-UPED queued, request #302, limit 200, 2 files]
            @

        2.  Print three files, assigning a jobname and  a  note  for  the
            header  page; postpone the printing.  Make 4 copies of one of
            the files, and double-space another one.

            @PRINT /JOBNAME:COMFIL/NOTE:CONFIDENTIAL/AFTER:12-DEC-79 FOO

            There is 1 job in the queue (none in progress)

            @

        3.  Print a job in a hurry, by  assigning  a  high  priority  and

   PUNCH



   Places requests in a card punch or paper tape punch output queue.


   Format


         PUNCH        medium         /switch(es) filespec/switch(es),...        @PUNCH (ONTO) medium (FILES) /switch(es) filespec/switch(es),...

        where

        medium         is the name of the medium on  which  you  want  to
                       punch your file(s).  It can be either

                               CARDS
                            or
                               PAPER-TAPE

        switches       are  keywords,  chosen  from   the   list   below,
                       indicating  your  choice of PUNCH command options.
                       These switches are of two kinds:  job switches and
                       file switches.

                       Job switches apply to all files specified  in  the
                       command, no matter where you give the switches.

                       File switches have different effects depending  on
                       their  positions  in  the  command  line:   placed
                       before all files  in  the  command,  they  act  as
                       defaults  for  all; otherwise they affect only the
                       nearest preceding file.

                            Defaults are shown in the list of switches

        filespec       is the specification of a file you wish to  punch.
                       You  can  use  wildcard  characters  (%  and *) to
                       specify more than one file.

        ,...           means that, after  a  comma,  you  can  give  more
                       arguments of the form already shown

               day  of  week (or TODAY)
               and/or time       ensures that the job will not be punched

                                 specified.     NOV-12-79    and    18:00
                                 illustrate two arguments to this switch.
                                 If you give both date and time, separate
                                 them  with  a  space.  When given alone,
                                 the time may be preceded by a plus  sign
                                 (+),  which will delay processing by the
                                 indicated  length  of  time   from   the
                                 present.

                                 Alternatively, you can give a day of the
                                 week   (e.g.,   MONDAY)   or   TODAY  as
                                 argument;  then  the  job  will  not  be
                                 punched   until  the  beginning  of  the
                                 following  day.   If  you  follow   this
                                 argument  with  a  plus sign and a time,
                                 the job will be further delayed by  this
                                 amount.

        /DESTINATION-NODE:node-name
                                 specifies the  DECnet  network  node  on
                                 whose  card  punch  or  paper tape punch
|                                your request is to  be  satisfied.   Two
|                                colons  (::) following the node name are
|                                optional.

        /FORMS:forms name        specifies, in six or  fewer  characters,
                                 the  forms  (determining  the weight and
                                 color of card or paper stock,  the  size
                                 of banner, header, and trailer sections,
                                 etc.)  to  use  for  the  punching  job.
                                 Using  this  switch may delay processing
                                 until the operator can mount the  proper
                                 forms.   Note that your installation may
                                 provide a different default argument  to

                                 punch  to  be  used  for  satisfying the
                                 request; use this switch to  override  a

   Output


        Jobname, Request ID, Limit, Number of Input Files

             As soon as you complete a valid PUNCH  command,  the  system
             responds by printing, on your terminal, the jobname, request
             ID number, the output limit in number of cards  or  feet  of
             paper  tape assigned to the request, and the number of input
             files in the request.


   Characteristics


        Ordinary Operation - No Switches

             For most purposes you can use the PUNCH  command  with  just
             the medium and a series of filespecs for arguments.

        Switch Defaults Set by System Managers

             The defaults shown in the list of switches are  correct  for
             most  user  sites.   However, your system manager can change


                                    301



             some of those default settings.  The switches most  commonly
             affected  are:   /FORMS,  /HEADER and /NOHEADER, /LIMIT, and
             /PRIORITY.


   Hints


        Using the SET DEFAULT Commands

             If there are switches that you always or usually supply when
             using  PUNCH,  give  the  SET  DEFAULT  CARDS or SET DEFAULT
             PAPER-TAPE command to establish them  as  defaults  (at  the
             current  TOPS-20  command  level)  for the remainder of your
             terminal session.  The switches will then behave as  if  you
             had  typed  them  directly  after the command name.  You can
             supersede  any  of  these  default  switches   by   actually
             supplying  the switch, with another value, when you give the
             PUNCH command.  Put SET DEFAULT  commands  into  a  file  of
             specification  COMAND.CMD  in  your  log-in directory if you
             want these default switches to be in effect for  all  levels
             of future terminal sessions as well.


   Special Cases


        /SPOOLED-OUTPUT Switch

             You can give the special switch,  /SPOOLED-OUTPUT,  as  sole
             argument  to  the  PUNCH  CARDS or PUNCH PAPER-TAPE command.
             This causes any spooled output  accumulated  so  far  during
             your  terminal session to be placed in a card punch or paper
             tape punch queue immediately, rather than at  log-out  time.
             The  /SPOOLED-OUTPUT  switch  is  useful  only  if  the  SET
             SPOOLED-OUTPUT DEFERRED command is in effect.  Programs that
             you  run  (especially  FORTRAN  programs) may create spooled
             paper tape punch or card punch output.  Or you can create it
             directly  by giving the command, COPY filespec PTP:, or COPY
             filespec CDP:, respectively, or by giving a CREF command.


   Effect on Memory and Terminal


        The PUNCH command does not affect memory and leaves your terminal
        at TOPS-20 command level.

   PUSH



|  Creates a new level of TOPS-20 inferior to the one from which you give
   the PUSH command.


   Format


         PUSH        @PUSH (COMMAND LEVEL)


   Characteristics


        A New Level of TOPS-20

|            The PUSH command creates a inferior  level  of  the  TOPS-20
|            command  processing (EXEC) than you were using.  The file of
             specification  COMAND.CMD  in  your  log-in   directory   is
             executed  again,  you  have  a  fresh copy of memory and can
             begin  giving  commands  as  if  you  had  just  logged  in.
             However,  job-wide  parameters (e.g., connected and accessed
             directories,  logical  name  definitions,  most   parameters
             altered  by SET commands) are unaffected by the PUSH command
             and retain their values from just before PUSH.


   Hints


|       Creating a Different Copy of an EXEC
|  
|            You can use the PUSH command to create a inferior  level  of
|            an  EXEC  of  your  choice.  Normally, PUSH creates the EXEC
|            defined by the system logical name, DEFAULT-EXEC:.  Use  the
|            DEFINE  command to define a job logical name, DEFAULT-EXEC:,
|            with the name of the EXEC you want to create each  time  you
|            PUSH.
|  
|            Note  that  many  TOPS-20  programs  have  their  own   PUSH
|            commands.   However,  only  the  EXEC  and OPR PUSH commands
|            currently refer to the job's definition of DEFAULT-EXEC:.


        Using CONTINUE STAY With PUSH

             You can use the PUSH command to run two programs at once  or
             to do other work that requires more than one copy of memory.
|            Simply  use  the  CONTINUE  /STAY  or  CONTINUE  /BACKGROUND


                                    305



             command to continue execution of your current program before
             using PUSH.  After PUSH  you  can  run  another  program  or
             otherwise  alter  memory  without  affecting  memory for the
             first program.  See Example 2.  But see also Warning, below.

|            You can also run multiple programs with  multiforking.   For
|            more information, see the KEEP command.


   Restrictions


        Number of Successive PUSH commands

             You can give as many pairs  of  PUSH  and  POP  commands  as
             necessary  to complete your task.  Although there is a limit
             to the number of times you  can  give  PUSH  without  giving
             intervening   POP  commands,  this  limit  is  large  enough
             (approximately 24, although smaller  for  a  heavily  loaded
|            system) not to interfere with most applications.  There is a
|            smaller limit (usually 5) on the number of  EXECs  that  can
|            give Queue-class commands.
|  
|            Use the INFORMATION  SUPERIOR  command  to  learn  how  many
|            superior EXEC levels you have created.


|       Invalid Definition of DEFAULT-EXEC:
|  
|            If you define DEFAULT-EXEC:  with the name of a  nonexistent
|            EXEC,  if,  (for  example, you make a spelling error in your
|            DEFINE  command),  the  PUSH  command  ignores   the   job's
|            definition of DEFAULT-EXEC:  and creates the EXEC defined by
|            the system definition.


        Withheld Log-out Capability

             You can usually log out from a lower level of  TOPS-20  than
             the   one  to  which  you  logged  in.   By  doing  so,  you
             simultaneously conclude all processes of your job.  However,
             if a program  (e.g., PTYCON)  has initialized a level of the
             TOPS-20  command  processor   but   has   withheld   log-out
             capability  from it, you must use the POP command, followed,
             if necessary, by a program command to exit from the  program
             and  return to a higher level of TOPS-20, before you can log
             out.


   Warning




                                    306



        Competition Between Processes

             If you  have  two  programs  running  at  once  after  using
|            CONTINUE  /STAY  or  CONTINUE  /BACKGROUND and PUSH commands
             (see Hints, above) they may try to access the same files  at
             the  same  time.   Or,  TOPS-20  commands given at the lower
             level may be intercepted by a program running at the  higher
             level.   For  a  discussion  of these possibilities, see the
             Restrictions section of the CONTINUE command description.


   Effect on Memory and Terminal


        The PUSH command preserves your present memory, gives you a fresh
        copy of memory, and leaves your terminal at a new TOPS-20 command
        level.


   Related Commands


|       CONTINUE /STAY   for beginning  execution  of  a  program  before
                         giving the PUSH command

*       INFORMATION      for displaying  the   number  of  superior  EXEC
*       SUPERIOR         levels.

        POP              for returning to a previous level of TOPS-20


   Examples


        1.  Give the PUSH command.

            @PUSH

             TOPS-20 Command processor 6(764)
            @

        2.  Run a program, and give a CTRL/C to return to TOPS-20 command
|           level.    Give  a  CONTINUE  /STAY  command  to  resume  this
            program's execution, and then a PUSH command for a  new  copy
            of  the TOPS-20 command language.  Repeat this process twice;
            now you have three programs running at once.  In  the  lowest
            (fourth)  level  of  your  job, begin editing a file.  (Note:
            when running more than one program in this way, be sure  that
            they  do  not  use  the  same compiler or the same data base;
            otherwise, competition among them could  cause  unpredictable
            situations to develop.)

   R



   Places an executable system program in memory and starts it.


   Format


         R           filespec        @R (PROGRAM) filespec /switch

        where

        filespec       is  the  file  specification  of  any   executable
                       program
                            Default                            Default dev:<directory> - SYS:

                            Default                            Default .typ - .EXE

        /switch   is        /USE-SECTION:n
                            specifies the memory section (from  0  to  37
                            octal)  in which your program is to run.  You
                            can use this switch only if your program  can
                            be contained in one section.


   Characteristics


        Need for of R Command

|            Although in most cases you can run system programs by simply
|            typing  the  program name in place of an EXEC command, the R
             command is necessary for running a program whose name is the
|            same  as  an  EXEC  command  or  an abbreviation for an EXEC
|            command.  For example, if your site  has  a  system  program
|            named CONNECT, it must be run with the R command in order to
|            distinguish it from the EXEC's CONNECT command.  If you have
|            a system program named GE, it must be run with the R command
|            to distinguish it from  the  GE  abbreviation  for  the  GET
|            command.
|  
|  
|       Cancels the Ephemeral Attribute
|  
|            If a system program has been set  ephemeral  by  the  system
|            manager  or, you have given a SET PROGRAM EPHEMERAL command,
|            you can  cancel  the  ephemeral  attribute  by  running  the
|            program  with  the  R  command instead of typing the program
|            name as an EXEC command.



                                    309



|            For more information on the  ephemeral  attribute,  see  the
|            ERUN command.


   Hints


        Defining SYS:

             If you redefine logical name SYS:  to be different from  the
             system-wide  definition,  you  should  include  SYS:  in the
             search list if you want to use the R command to  run  system
             programs.   For  further  information,  refer to the section
             entitled, "Redefining System Logical Names," in  the  DEFINE
             command description.


   Effect on Memory and Terminal


        The R command clears any  unkept  forks,  places  in  memory  and
        starts the specified program, and leaves your terminal at command
        level in the program (if any), or at TOPS-20 command level.

   RECEIVE



   Notifies the system that  you  are  willing  to  accept  communication
|  links,  advice  from other users, messages from other users, or system
   messages.


   Format


         RECEIVE argument        @RECEIVE argument

        where

        argument            is a keyword, chosen  from  the  list  below,

                            willing to accept


                         RECEIVE Command Arguments


        ADVICE              allows  both  assistance  and   communication
                            links  initiated  by another user's ADVISE or
                            TALK command

        LINK                allows  communication  links  established  by
                            another user's TALK command

|       SYSTEM-MESSAGES     allows notices of new mail  and  messages  of
                            interest to all users sent by the operator or
                            other privileged users

|       USER-MESSAGES       allows messages sent by another  user's  SEND
|                           command
                                 Default|                                Default - LINKS, SYSTEM-MESSAGES, and
|                                          USER-MESSAGES


   Hint


        Typing RECEIVE During Attempted TALK

             If your terminal has been set to refuse  links  and  another
             user  tries  to  talk to you by using the TALK command, both
             terminals will give a  series  of  CTRL/G  signals  (ringing
             bells or beeps) indicating the refused attempt.  If you give
             the RECEIVE LINKS command before these signals are finished,
             the TALK command will succeed.

   REENTER



   Starts your currently loaded program at its alternate entry point.


   Format


         REENTER        @REENTER (PROGRAM)


   Characteristics


        Using REENTER

             The REENTER command  starts  your  program  at  the  address
             specified  by the second word in the program's entry vector.
             For most programs this address is contained in location 124.
             Usually  the REENTER and START commands start the program at
             the same point, but another re-entry point can  be  provided
             to  avoid initialization procedures, perform error recovery,
             or to use the program in a different way.


   Hints


        Further Information

                                                                  _______             For more information about entry vectors,  see  the  TOPS-20
             _______ _____ _________ ______             Monitor Calls Reference Manual.


   Effect on Memory and Terminal


        The REENTER command  does  not  affect  memory  and  leaves  your
        terminal at a level determined by the program.

   Hints


        Typing RECEIVE During Attempted TALK


                                    317



             If your terminal has been set to refuse  links  and  another
             user  tries  to  talk to you by using the TALK command, both
             terminals will give a  series  of  CTRL/G  signals  (ringing
             bells or beeps) indicating the refused attempt.  If you give
             the RECEIVE LINKS command before these signals are finished,
             the TALK command will succeed.

|       Safeguarding Terminal Output

             If you want your terminal to  print  a  long  file,  without
|            interference,  use  the  TERMINAL INHIBIT command to prevent
             all classes of message from being received.  Be sure to  use
|            the  TERMINAL  NO  INHIBIT command afterwards to restore the
             previous condition of your terminal.


   Special Cases


        Implicit Refusal of Advice

             If you give the REFUSE LINKS command, your terminal will  be
             set   to  refuse  advice  also.   However,  the  INFORMATION
             TERMINAL-MODE command may not display  this  setting  unless
             you give an explicit REFUSE ADVICE command as well.

        Privileged Disregard of REFUSE

             A user with enabled Wheel or Operator capabilities can  give
             the TALK or ADVISE command for any job.


   Effect on Memory and Terminal


        The REFUSE  command  does  not  affect  memory  and  leaves  your

   REMARK



   Tells the system to regard the terminal input that follows as  comment
   only.


   Format


         REMARK        @REMARK (MODE)
        Type remark.  End with CTRL/Z.


   Characteristics


        Ending Remarks

             Until you give a CTRL/Z, the system merely displays what you
             type, instead of trying to interpret it as commands.


   Hints


        Useful During TALK or ADVISE Session

             If you have already established contact with another user by
             a  TALK or ADVISE command before giving REMARK, his terminal
             will also display what you type.  Give  the  REMARK  command
             before  sending  lengthy  comments or demonstrating commands
             that you don't want to take effect.


   Effect on Memory and Terminal


        The REMARK  command  does  not  affect  memory  and  leaves  your
        terminal at remark level.

   RENAME



   Changes the name of a file.


   Format


         RENAME                 old filespec(s)         new filespec        @RENAME (EXISTING FILE) old filespec(s) (TO BE) new filespec

        where

        old filespec(s)     is a single file specification, or  a  series
                            of  them separated by commas and/or indicated
                            by wildcard characters (% and *)

        new filespec        is the new specification under which you want
|                           to  store  the file(s); the new specification
|                           must  be  on  the  same  structure;  you  may
                            include an asterisk (*) if you gave more than
                            one old filespec.
                                 Default                                 Default new filespec - old filespec, but
                                         with  a generation number higher
                                         by 1 than the  highest  existing
                                         generation number


   Output


        Status of Files

             If you use recognition on the new  file  specification,  the
             system  prints  !Old  Generation!, !New Generation!, or !New
             File!, to describe its status.

        Confirmation of Action

             As each file is renamed, the system prints its old  and  new
             specification, and the word [Superseding] if it is replacing
             previous contents, and finally the  word  [OK].   The  delay
             before  you  see  this  [OK]  indicates  how long it took to
             rename the file.


   Characteristics


        Efficiency of RENAME



                                    322



|            The RENAME command is faster and  more  efficient  than  the
|            COPY  command  for transferring files from one specification
             to another within a structure.  This is because RENAME  only
             changes  the  file  specifications;  the  contents  are  not
             copied.  Also, RENAME saves you from deleting  any  unwanted
             source files that are left after a COPY command.


   Hints


        Specifying a New Account and Protection Number

             You can specify the new file's  protection  number  and  the
             account  to  which its storage fees will be charged.  Follow
             the new filespec with a  semicolon  (;)  and  the  letter  P
             before  giving  a  new 6-digit protection number, and with a
             semicolon and the letter A  before  giving  a  new  account.
             Ordinarily   these  values  are  set  to  the  default  file
             protection  and  current  account.    However,   non-default
             protection numbers will be maintained for higher generations
             of existing files,  unless  you  specify  otherwise  in  the
             RENAME command that creates that higher generation.


   Restrictions


        Renaming Between Structures

             You cannot rename a file from one structure to another,  but
             must  use  the COPY command to reproduce its contents on the
             new structure, then the DELETE command to remove it from the
             old structure.

        Renaming Open or Mapped Files

             You cannot rename a file that is open or mapped into memory.
             First  give  the RESET command, or POP followed by RESET, if
             this is the case.

        Renaming Archived Files

             You can rename an archived file  by  specifying  it  as  the
             first  (or  old) argument of a RENAME command.  It will then
             have the second (or new) argument as its  specification  and
             will  remain an archived file.  However, you cannot give the
             specification of an archived file as the second argument  of
             a RENAME command, as this would replace the file's contents.
             If you attempt to do so, the file you specify as  the  first
             argument  will  be  renamed to a generation higher by 1 than
             the  highest  existing  generation  of  the  archived  file,


                                    323



             leaving the archived file intact.


   Warning


        Replacing Previous Contents of Files

             If  you  rename  a  file  into  a  specification  (including
             generation   number)   that  already  exists,  the  previous
             contents  of  the  new  file  are  replaced  and  cannot  be
             recovered.   But see Restrictions - Renaming Archived Files,
             above.


   Effect on Memory and Terminal


        The RENAME  command  does  not  affect  memory  and  leaves  your
        terminal at TOPS-20 command level.


   Related Commands


        COPY     for making copies of files


   Examples


        1.  Rename a file.

            @RENAME ATM-50.SPC ATM-50.PRL
             ATM-50.SPC.1 => ATM-50.PRL.1 [OK]
            @

        2.  Use a wildcard character to rename all files of a given name.

            @RENAME ATM-50.* 1-ATM-50.*
             ATM-50.BAK.1 => 1-ATM-50.BAK.1 [OK]
             ATM-50.PRL.1 => 1-ATM-50.PRL.1 [OK]
            @

        3.  Access another user directory and transfer to  it  the  files
            renamed in Example 2.

            @ACCESS <ORBEN>
            Password:
            @RENAME 1-ATM-50.* <ORBEN>
             1-ATM-50.BAK.1 => <ORBEN>1-ATM-50.BAK.1 [OK]

   RESET



|  Clears memory of the specified forks.


   Format


         RESET|       @RESET (FORK) argument
|  
|       where
|  
|       argument is one of the following:  Fork name
|                                          Octal fork number
|                                          * for all forks

   Characteristics


        Action of RESET

|            In addition to clearing memory for the specified forks,  the
|            RESET  command closes all files, mapped and unmapped, opened
|            by  the  specified  forks  and  their  inferior  forks.   It
|            simultaneously  terminates  the  specified  fork's  inferior
|            forks.


   Effect on Memory and Terminal


|       The RESET command clears  memory  for  the  specified  forks  and
        leaves your terminal at TOPS-20 command level.

   RETRIEVE



|  Returns an off-line file (magnetic tape copy of a file) to disk.


   Format


         RETRIEVE         filespec,...        @RETRIEVE (FILES) filespec,...

        where

        filespec              is the specification of any  off-line  file
                              (archived  or not, visible or invisible) to
                              which you  have  access;  you  may  include
                              wildcard characters (% and *).

        ,...                  means that, after a  comma,  you  can  give
                              more arguments of the form already shown


   Output


        Acknowledgment of Request

             As soon as you complete a valid RETRIEVE command, the system
             responds by printing, on your terminal, the specification of
             each  off-line  file  for  which  you  requested  retrieval,
             followed by [OK].

        Notice of Retrieval Sent to Requestor

|            Depending on the procedures at your site, when the files for
|            which  you  have  requested  retrieval have been restored to
|            their directory on disk, you may receive a mail message that
|            contains  the  names  of each retrieved file.  Read it using
|            the RDMAIL or DECmail/MS program.  Remember that,  depending
             on  how  frequently  your site processes retrieval requests,
             this message may not be sent until one or  more  days  after
             your request.


   Characteristics


        Invisibility of Retrieved Files


             If you retrieve invisible files, they will remain  invisible


                                    328



             (whether  archived  or  not) when restored to disk.  Use the
             SET FILE VISIBLE command to make  invisible  files  visible.
             Until  you  do so, they will be inaccessible to most TOPS-20
             commands.


   Hints


        Using Retrieved Archived Files

             As long as a retrieved archived file  is  visible,  you  can
             inspect  it  using  the  TYPE  or PRINT command, or list its
             specifications using DIRECTORY-class commands.  However, you
             cannot  add  to  it  or  change  it (e.g, by using APPEND or
             EDIT).  To make changes to a copy of  a  retrieved  archived
             file,  first  use  the  COPY  command  to  copy  it to a new
             specification.  If you wish, you can then  request  archival
             for this new file (using the ARCHIVE command) and delete the
             old  one  (using  the  DELETE  command  with  the   ARCHIVED
             subcommand).  You can return an (unchanged) on-line archived
             file to off-line status by using the DELETE command with the
             CONTENTS-ONLY  subcommand,  or  withdraw archive status from
             the file (i.e., make it an ordinary disk file) by using  the
             DISCARD command.

        Using Retrieved Non-archived Files

             As long as a retrieved non-archived file is visible, you can
             use  TOPS-20  commands  with it as with any other disk file.
             The only difference is  that  after  any  command  that  has
             changed  the  file (e.g, EDIT), the tape copy of the file is
             no longer valid.  This means that you cannot give the DELETE
             command with the CONTENTS-ONLY subcommand to return the file
             to off-line status.


   Special Cases


        Implied Retrieval Requests

             If your system has enabled  the  "automatic  retrieval-wait"
             feature  (give the INFORMATION SYSTEM-STATUS command to find
             out whether it has), and the SET RETRIEVAL-WAIT  command  is
             in  effect for your job, any command that attempts to use an
             off-line file will create an automatic retrieval request for
             that file.  Under these conditions, commands such as TYPE or
             COPY for which  you  specify  off-line  files  will  not  be
             executed until those files are retrieved.  Implied retrieval
             requests are most useful in batch jobs.

   REWIND



   Returns a magnetic tape to its  load  point  (logical  beginning,  the
   beginning of the first file).


   Format


        @REWIND          dev:        @REWIND (DEVICE) dev:  /switch

        where

        dev:           is the name of the tape set or magnetic tape drive
*                      that  you  want  to  rewind.   The colon after the
*                      device name is optional.

        /switch        is one of the following:


                            /CURRENT-VOLUME-ONLY
                                           rewinds tape set to  beginning
                                           of currently mounted volume

                            /ENTIRE-VOLUME-SET
                                           rewinds tape set to  beginning
                                           of first volume
                                           Default                                           Default - ENTIRE-VOLUME-SET

                              Note:   these switches can be used only for
                                      devices   of  the  form  MTn:,  not
                                      MTAn:.


   Restrictions


        REWIND with Open Files

             If you have given a CTRL/C to exit from a program  that  has
             opened  a  magnetic  tape  set  and you then give the REWIND
             command for that tape set, the system will first ask if  you
             want  to  close  the  associated  file.   You must do so for
             REWIND to succeed, but will probably be unable  to  continue
             the  program  from  that  point because the file will now be
             closed.


   Effect on Memory and Terminal



                                    334



        The REWIND  command  does  not  affect  memory  and  leaves  your
        terminal at TOPS-20 command level.

   RUN



   Places an executable program in memory and starts it.


   Format


         RUN                    /switch        @RUN (PROGRAM) filespec /switch

        where

        filespec       is  the  file  specification  of  any   executable
                       program
                            Default                            Default dev:<dir> - DSK:

                            Default                            Default .typ - .EXE

        /switch        is /USE-SECTION:n
                                      specifies the memory section  (from
                                      0   to  37  octal)  in  which  your
                                      program is to  run.   You  can  use
                                      this  switch  only  if your program
                                      can be contained in one section.


   Characteristics


        Efficiency of RUN

             The RUN command does the work of the pair  of  commands  GET
             and  START.   It  is  a  faster  and less expensive means of
             executing programs than EXECUTE, or  than  LOAD  and  START.
             Therefore  you  should store frequently-run programs in .EXE
             files and run them with this command.


   Effect on Memory and Terminal


|       The RUN command clears any unkept  forks,  places  the  specified
|       program  in memory, and starts it leaves your terminal at command
        level in the program (if any), or at TOPS-20 command level.

        START       for starting the program currently in memory


   Examples

   SAVE



   Stores a copy of memory in an executable file.


   Format

    SAVE           filespec               loc1      loc2, loc3 loc4, ...   @SAVE (ON FILE) filespec  (PAGES FROM) loc1 (TO) loc2, loc3 loc4, ...

   where

        filespec     is the file specification under which  you  want  to
                     store the program
                          Default                          Default filespec - program name.EXE

        loc1 loc2,   are pairs  of octal numbers  or symbolic expressions
        loc3 loc4,   that specify the span(s) of memory pages you want to
        ...          save
                          Default                    assigned                          Default  loc1  loc2 - all  assigned  pages   of
                                          memory  from  0  to the highest
                                          page  number  of  the   highest
                                          existing section


   Output


        Status of Files

             If you use recognition of the file specification, the system
             prints !Old Generation!, !New Generation!, or !New File!, to
             indicate its status on disk, or !OK!  if saved on a non-disk
             device.


   Hints


        Saving Programs Before Running Them

             When you load a source or  object  program  using  the  LOAD
             command, save it using SAVE before running it.  Then you can
             run it in the future using RUN,  without  first  loading  it
             using  a  LOAD-class command.  This is also true if you save
             the program after running it, but  it  will  then  be  in  a
             post-run state.

        More Information

                                                                  _______             For more information about  saved  files,  see  the  TOPS-20

|  Restriction
|  
|       Saving an Execute-only Compiler
|  
|            It is illegal to use the SAVE command after using  the  LOAD
|            command  for an execute-only compiler.  An alternative is to
|            use LINK with the LOAD command and the /SAVE switch.


   Effect on Memory and Terminal


        The SAVE command does not affect memory and leaves your  terminal
        at TOPS-20 command level.


   Related Commands

|  
|       Multiple-line Messages
|  
|            SEND allows you to send multiple-line messages  with  up  to
|            six.  80-character lines of text.  Type the message past the
|            end of the first line and onto the next line without  typing
|            RETURN.  SEND will reorganize your message on the receiver's
|            terminal so that words broken across two lines appear on the
|            same line.
|  
|  
|       Refused SEND
|  
|            You cannot contact a user with SEND if his terminal  is  set
|            to  refuse messages with the REFUSE USER-MESSAGES command or
|            the TERMINAL INHIBIT command.  If you attempt to SEND  to  a
|            user  who  has  refused user-messages, the system prints the
|            message ?User is refusing messages and/or links.
|  
|            A user with Wheel or Operator capabilities enabled, can SEND
|            messages  to  users who have given a REFUSE USER-MESSAGES or
|            TERMINAL INHIBIT command.

|  
|            To get the attention of the user at the receiving  terminal,
|            type  a  few  CTRL/Gs  in  your message.  This will ring the
|            terminal bell on the receiving terminal.
|  
|  
|       SEND in a Batch Job
|  
|            You can place SEND commands in a batch control file to  send
|            messages  to  your  terminal  on  the condition of a running
|            batch job.
|  
|  
|       SEND as an Alternative to Mail
|  
|            The SEND command can be used as an alternative to sending  a
|            message  with one of the mail programs.  For short messages,
|            SEND can be more convenient and faster to use  than  a  mail
|            program.   For  urgent  messages,  a  SEND  message  is read
|            immediately by the receiver, unlike a mail message which can
|            be read at the user's leisure.
|  
|  
*  Special Cases
*  
*       User Has More Than One Job
*  
*            If you attempt to SEND a message to a user that is logged-in
*            on  more  than one terminal, the system responds with a list
*            of the user's terminal line numbers and the  programs  being
*            run  at  each  terminal.   Type your choice of terminal line
*            numbers (if available, the one running the EXEC)  after  the
*            TTY:  prompt.
|  
|  
|  Effect on Memory and Terminal
|  
|  
|       The SEND command does not affect memory and leaves your  terminal
|       at TOPS-20 command level.

|                                fork  is already loaded.  A kept fork is

|                                the  fork  name  as  an  EXEC   command.
|                                CONTINUE begins the program at the point
|                                where it was halted.  REENTER begins the
|                                program at its reentry address (for some
|                                programs the reentry address is the same
|                                as the start address).  START begins the
|                                program  at  its  start  address.    The
|                                system  informs  you  when  the  fork is
|                                "kept"   with   the   message   [Keeping
|                                fork-name].  When you type the kept fork
|                                name,   the   system    responds    with

|  
|                                This command automatically  keeps  forks
|                                that  are  loaded  by  typing the system

   Characteristics


        Affect Only Current Terminal Session

             The SET command, except for  SET  DIRECTORY  and  SET  FILE,
             applies  to  the  current terminal session only, and in most
             cases only to the current level of TOPS-20 in that  session.
             Therefore  put  SET  DEFAULT,  SET CONTROL-C-CAPABILITY, and
             other SET commands into a COMAND.CMD  file  in  your  log-in
             directory  if  you  want them to be in effect every time you
             log in or give the PUSH command.


   Hints


        Using SET PAGE-ACCESS

             A SET PAGE-ACCESS command can take several arguments on  the
             same   line,  with  cumulative  effect;  contradictions  are
             resolved  in  favor  of  the  last  item  given.    So   SET
             PAGE-ACCESS  6  EXECUTE  NO  COPY-ON-WRITE NO WRITE allows a
             user to execute page 6 but not to change it; SET PAGE-ACCESS
             7 NO WRITE WRITE allows changes to page 7.

             To Make Modifiable Copies of Write-protected Programs


             Because the SAVE command preserves the write  protection  of
             files,  you  should  use  the  SET  PAGE ACCESS WRITE or SET
             PAGE-ACCESS COPY-ON-WRITE command before giving SAVE if  you
             want to save a modifiable copy of a program.

        Using SET TIME-LIMIT

             Although the SET TIME-LIMIT command is  ordinarily  used  by
             the  batch  system  to  limit  the  runtime of jobs, you can
             employ it as a timesharing user to give you  a  fatal  error
             message  when  the  specified  amount  of  CPU time has been
             spent.  To find out how much of this  time  you  have  left,
             give   the  SYSTAT . LIMIT  and  INFORMATION  PROGRAM-STATUS
             commands.  The difference between  the  SYSTAT . LIMIT  time
             and  the  "Used" time reported by INFORMATION PROGRAM-STATUS

                                    366



             SET ADDRESS-BREAK

                  SET ADDRESS-BREAK shows you  how  often  and  for  what
                  purpose  a  memory  address  is  referenced.   When  an
                  address break occurs, a message will  show  the  memory
                  location  at  which  execution  of  your  program  will
                  resume.

             SET  NO  CONTROL-C-CAPABILITY,   SET   UUO-SIMULATION,   SET
                  PAGE-ACCESS

                  If  you  are  debugging  a  program,  use  the  SET  NO
                  CONTROL-C-CAPABILITY command to ensure that you can use
                  CTRL/C to leave the program.  Test a program that traps
                  CTRL/Cs  by having it trap, say, CTRL/As instead during
                  debugging.  Also, setting NO  CONTROL-C-CAPABILITY,  NO
                  UUO-SIMULATION,    or    PAGE-ACCESS    NO   WRITE   NO
                  COPY-ON-WRITE will show you what part  of  the  program
                  (if any) is attempting to use these features.

        Alternative to SET FILE PROHIBIT for Non-privileged Users

             Even if you do not have sufficient privileges to use the SET
             FILE  PROHIBIT  command, you can still do something to delay
             the removal of important files to off-line storage.   Create
             a file named MIGRATION.ORDER in each directory for which you
             wish to control migration.  The contents of this file should
             be  the specifications of files that you want to be migrated
             first, when migration is performed.  You  may  use  wildcard
             characters  (*  and  %)  to  specify more than one file.  To
             protect source programs, for example, you could specify that
             executable  programs  and binary files be migrated first, by
             listing  "*.EXE,  *.REL"  in  MIGRATION.ORDER.   To  protect
             edited  files,  you  could  list  "*.Q*"  (this ensures that
             unedited back-up files  produced  by  the  EDIT  program  be
             migrated  before the edited versions).  Any files not listed
             in MIGRATION.ORDER will be protected  from  migration  until
             all  listed  files  have been migrated.  Remember that, even
             without being  listed  in  MIGRATION.ORDER,  files  are  not
             usually  migrated to off-line storage if they have been used
             or changed within a period of time specified by your  system
             manager.

             The SET FILE RESIST command also offers  limited  protection
             against involuntary migration.


   Restrictions

        Using SET Commands in Batch Jobs

             Put SET commands  into  a  BATCH.CMD  file  in  your  log-in


                                    367



             directory  if  you want them to apply to the first (highest)
             level of TOPS-20 in batch jobs you  submit;  put  them  into
             COMAND.CMD  in  your  log-in  directory  if you want them to
|            apply to all levels of TOPS-20 in both batch and interactive
             jobs.    Remember,  though,  that  you  must  not  give  SET
             CONTROL-C-CAPABILITY, SET NO TIME-LIMIT, or  SET  TIME-LIMIT
             (or the ATTACH command) within any batch job.


        Using SET DIRECTORY Commands

             You will be able to use the SET DIRECTORY commands  only  if
             your  system  is instructed at system start-up time to allow
             them.  Otherwise, the system will send you error messages in
             response to SET DIRECTORY commands.


   Effect on Memory and Terminal

        The SET command does not affect memory and leaves  your  terminal
        at TOPS-20 command level.


   Examples

        1.  Set the LATE-CLEAR-TYPEAHEAD parameter for your job.

                 @SET LATE-CLEAR-TYPEAHEAD
                 @

        2.  Find out the placement of your  program  in  memory;  set  an
            address  break to occur at location 2412 when the instruction
            it contains has been  executed  six  times.   Then  give  the
            INFORMATION  ADDRESS-BREAK  command  to  see the location and
            operation for which the current address break has been set.

        4.  Put an executable program into memory and set the page access
            of its first page to NO COPY-ON-WRITE; try to deposit a value
            (32) in memory location 500 of the page (this  fails).   Then
            set  its  page  access  to  COPY-ON-WRITE  and try once more,

        5.  Learn what files are opened when you edit a file.

                 @SET TRAP FILE-OPENINGS 
                 @EDIT LOGIN.CMD

                 [LOGIN.CMD.34]
                 @

        6.  Cause a trap to occur whenever the GTFDB  JSYS  is  executed.
            Then  edit  a  file.  The EDIT command invokes the GTFDB JSYS
            and causes a line to type out in the following format:

                 [fork  "trap"  <location>/<jsys   name>   "Ac's   1-4:"   <ac
                 contents>]

            Note that  the  location  is  in  symbolic  form  if  you  so
            specified in the SET TYPEOUT MODE command.

                 @SET TRAP JSYS GTFDB
                 @EDIT LOGIN.CMD
                 [EDIT trap 3515/ GTFDB Ac's 1-4: 11\ 1000004\ 20321\ 424153000000]
                 [EDIT trap 3562/ GTFDB Ac's 1-4: 11\ 2000011\ 4\ 424153000000]
                 Edit: LOGIN.CMD.42
                 *EU

                 [LOGIN.CMD.43]
                 @

        7.  Specify that program execution is to halt  whenever  a  GTFDB
            JSYS  causes  a  trap.   Then  edit a file.  The EDIT command
            invokes the GTFDB JSYS, causing a trap to occur, which causes
            the EDIT process to immediately halt.

                 @SET TRAP NO PROCEED
                 @SET TRAP JSYS GTFDB
                 @EDIT LOGIN.CMD
                 [EDIT trap 3515/ GTFDB Ac's 1-4: 10\ 1000004\ 20321\ 424153000000]
                 @

        8.  Arrange for the system to remind you of a future  obligation.
            Then verify that you will be reminded.

                 @SET ALERT (AT TIME) MONDAY +11:00:00 Turn in last week's time card by noon

|      10.  Arrange for the system to check for new  mail  in  your  MAIL
|           file  and  in the MAIL file of user AI.GROUP.  Notice the two
|           messages indicating that you  and  AI.GROUP  have  new  mail.
|           Then, cancel mail watching for user AI.GROUP.

|                @SET MAIL-WATCH
|                @SET MAIL-WATCH AI.GROUP

|                @SET NO MAIL-WATCH AI.GROUP

|  
|      11.  Use the DIRECTORY command to learn the name of the  directory
|           that  contains  a  system program.  Then enable your Wheel or
|           Operator privileges and set the system file ephemeral.

|                @DIRECTORY SYS:ISPELL

|      12.  Add one of your own directories to the definition of SYS:  so
|           that  you can run .EXE files in that directory by typing just
|           the file name.

|                @DEFINE SYS: => SYS:, STUDENTS:<DBONIN.TOOLS>

|           Next, set ephemeral  a  file  in  this  directory.   Run  the
|           program  in  an ephemeral fork by typing the file name.  Then
|           CTRL/C from the program.  Give  the  INFORMATION  FORK-STATUS
|           command  and  note  that  the  ephemeral fork CHANGE has been

*  
*  
*       Logging to the Remote Node
*  
*            Once your terminal is connected  to  the  remote  node,  the
*            system  responds  by identifying itself and prompting you to
*            log in.  You can then log in to the system.
*  
*       Path of Terminal Input and Output
*  
*            The SET HOST command passes terminal input through the local
*            host to the remote host.  Output from the remote host passes
*            through the local host to your terminal.
*  
*       Returning to Your Local Host
*  
*            To return  your  terminal  to  your  local  host,  type  the
*            interrupt  sequence  to  temporarily break the connection to
*            the remote host.  Note that the  connection  to  the  remote
*            host  remains intact until you reset the CTERM program.  You
*            can reconnect your terminal to the remote host by giving the
*            CONTINUE command.
*  
*            When you log out of  the  remote  host,  the  connection  is
*            broken and you are returned to your local host.
*  
*            If  you  have  established  a  series  of  connections,  the
*            interrupt  character  defined in your first SET HOST command
*            returns you to your local host.   For  example,  your  local
*            host  is  AURORA  and you SET HOST to BOSTON, specifying the
*            \<RET> interrupt sequence to return to  AURORA.   Then  from
*            BOSTON  you connect to DETROIT.  Typing the \<RET> interrupt
*            to DETROIT returns you to AURORA, not BOSTON.

*       Valid Interrupt Sequence Characters
*  
*             o  The interrupt sequence  can  be  a  combination  of  two
*                characters  or control characters.  For example, KL ^KL,
*                K^L, and ^K^L are valid interrupt sequences.
*  
*             o  If you specify only one interrupt character, the  second
*                character  is ^J.  For example if you specify only ^N as
*                the interrupt sequence, the actual interrupt sequence is
*                ^N^J.   If  you  type  only F, the interrupt sequence is
*                F^J.
*  
*             o  The  interrupt  characters  must  each  be  a  different
*                character.  For example, ^K^K is invalid, while ^KK is a
*                valid interrupt sequence.
*  
*             o  When specifying an inteerrupt sequence, do  not  type  a
*                comma or a space between the two characters.  If you do,
*                the  comma  or  space  is  interpreted  as  the   second
*                character in the sequence.
*  
*             o  The RETURN key can only be used in the default interrupt
*                sequence, ^\<RET>.
*  
*             o  Control characters in the interrupt sequence  cannot  be
*                predefined  control  characters.   For  example,  if you
*                attempt to specify an interrupt sequence as ^T^I, the ^T
*                will  print  the run status and the ^I will print a tab.
*                See Appendix D in this manual  for  a  list  of  TOPS-20
*                control characters.
*  
*       Making a Series of Host Connections
*  
*            Once you have logged in to a remote node, you can give  EXEC
*            commands  and  run  programs just as you would on your local
*            node.  You can then establish a connection to another remote
*            node.   For  example,  if your local host is AURORA, you can
*            give the command SET HOST BOSTON  to  connect  to  the  node
*            BOSTON;  after logging in to BOSTON, you can use the command
*            SET HOST DETROIT to connect to node DENVER.
*  
*       Controlling Scrolling on a Remote Host
*  
*            On your local host, <CTRL/S> and <CTRL/Q>  are  the  default
*            control   characters  that  pause  and  continue  scrolling.
*            Typing <CTRL/Q> continues scrolling whether scrolling paused
*            because  you  typed  <CTRL/S>  or  the  output  paused on an
*            end-of-page.
*  
*            However, CTERM does not pass these characters to the  remote
*            host.   When  using  <CTRL/S>  and <CTRL/Q>, it is the local
*            host that actually controls scrolling.  Therefore if  output


                                    375



*            from the remote hosts has paused on an end-of-page, <CTRL/Q>
*            will not  continue  scrolling.   Other  pause  and  continue
*            characters  are  passed  to  the  remote  host.  You can use
*            <CTRL/A> to both pause and resume scrolling or you  can  use
*            the  TERMINAL  PAUSE command to assign any two characters of
*            your choosing to control scrolling.  It is recommended  that
*            you  define  the  same pause and continue characters on your
*            local and remote node.

   SKIP



   Moves a magnetic tape set forward over a specified number of files  or
   records, or to the logical end of the tape set.


   Format


         SKIP          dev:  n units        @SKIP (DEVICE) dev:  n units

        where

        dev:      is the name of the tape set or magnetic tape drive that
                  you want to move forward

        n         is the number of files or records over which  you  want
*                 to skip . The colon after the device name is optional.

        units     is either FILES or RECORDS, where records are  sections
                  of  a  file; or LEOT, to skip to the logical end of the
                  tape set, which is the  next  point  on  the  tape  set
                  having two adjacent EOF (end-of-file) marks.
                       Default                       Default units - FILES


   Restrictions


        SKIP With Open Files

             If you have given a CTRL/C to exit from a program  that  has
             opened  a  file in a magnetic tape set and you then give the
             SKIP command for that tape set, the system will first ask if
             you  want  to close the associated file.  You must do so for
             SKIP to succeed, but you will probably be unable to continue
             the  program  from  that  point because the file will now be
             closed.

        RECORDS Argument Used for Unlabeled Tapes Only

             You cannot use the RECORDS argument to the SKIP command when
             using  a labeled tape, because read and write operations for
             labeled tapes always move the tape to  the  beginning  of  a
             file.


   Warning




                                    379



        Skipping Past LEOT (Unlabeled Tapes Only)

             If you specify too large a value for n in the  SKIP  command
             line,  you can move past the logical end of tape (LEOT).  In
             this case, the operator may have to  intervene  before  your
             tape  control  commands will have effect again.  You must be
             sure how many files you have in the tape set if you use SKIP
             n  rather  than  SKIP  LEOT.  This problem can occur for any
             tapes mounted on drives of the form MTAn:, or for  unlabeled
             tapes mounted on drives of the form MTn:.


   Effect on Memory and Terminal


        The SKIP command does not affect memory and leaves your  terminal
        at TOPS-20 command level.


   Related Commands

        UNLOAD    for rewinding  a  magnetic  tape  completely  onto  the
                  source  reel  (only  for tapes mounted on drives having
                  device names of the form MTAn:)


   Examples

        1.  Skip over the next 2 files on the magnetic tape you are using
            (mounted on magnetic tape drive MT0:  in this case).

            @SKIP MT0:  2 FILES
            @

        2.  Skip over the next two records on an unlabeled tape.

            @SKIP MTA0: 2 RECORDS
            @

        3.  Use the MOUNT command to ask the operator to mount your  tape
            in  write-enabled  mode,  then  copy 3 files to the tape from
            your directory on structure SNARK:.  Use the  REWIND  command
            to  go  back  to  the beginning, and the SKIP command to skip
            over the first file.  Use the COPY command to have  the  next
            file  (FIL-2)  printed  on  your terminal, then give the SKIP
            command again to skip to the logical  end-of-tape.   You  are
            skipping only one file, FIL-3, in this case.

             After running a program (with a RUN or EXECUTE  command,  or
             with  a GET and START or LOAD and START combination) you can
             usually run it again using START.   COBOL  programs  are  an

|            level, (see Hints - Using PUSH to Get a New TOPS-20  Command
|            Level,  above),  the  program  can  request  input  from the
|            terminal while you are giving input to the EXEC  or  another
|            program.   This  input  can  be  randomly intercepted by the
|            background program when it requests terminal input.
|  
|            When  terminal  input  is  intercepted  by  the   background
|            program, the program usually types input error messages.  To
|            give input to the program, stop the program  by  typing  two
|            CTRL/Cs  or  the  program's  exit  command.   Then,  if  the
|            background program is at a higher EXEC command  level,  give
|            POP  commands  to  return  to  the EXEC level that holds the
|            background program.  (POP terminates the  current  EXEC  and
|            erases  programs  in its memory.) Finally, give the CONTINUE
|            /NORMALLY command; this puts you at program command level so
|            that you can give the requested input.
|  
|            Input is intercepted by  the  background  program  randomly.
|            Therefore,  you may have to type extra CTRL/Cs, program exit
|            commands, and POPs.  To reduce confusion about the direction
|            of  terminal  input,  it  is  recommended that you use START
|            /STAY only when you plan to work at the current  EXEC  level
|            while  a  program  runs  in  a  background  fork.  Use START
|            /BACKGROUND when you plan to work at a lower EXEC  level  or


                                    383



|            at another program command level.
|  
|            When  a  program  started  with  START  BACKGROUND  requests
|            terminal  input,  it sends the message, [FORK-NAME wants the
|            TTY].  No input is taken by the background program until you
|            return to program command level with CONTINUE /NORMALLY.
|  
|       Execute-only Programs
|  
|            Programs that are execute-only can only be started at  their
|            normal starting address.


   Effect on Memory and Terminal


|       The START command starts the program in the current fork  at  the
|       specified address.

   Examples


        1.  Start the program currently in memory.

            @START

        2.  Put an executable program in memory and start it.   Then  run
            it again.

            @GET TESTF1.EXE
            @START

            THIS IS A TEST.

        3.  Begin using the FILCOM program to compare two files.  Give  a
            CTRL/C  to  halt  FILCOM,  then  a  CTRL/T  to  determine the
            location where it was stopped.  Give the DDT command, and  do
            some  work  within  the DDT program; leave DDT with a CTRL/Z,
            returning to TOPS-20 command level.  Give the  START  command
            to start FILCOM again, using as argument the address reported
            by CTRL/T above.

             As soon as you complete a valid SUBMIT command,  the  system
             responds by printing, on your terminal, the jobname, request
             ID, and time limit for  the  job.   Each  control  file  you
             submit  is  a  separate batch request, and is described on a
             separate line.


   Characteristics


        Ordinary Operation - No Switches

             For most purposes you can use the SUBMIT command with just a
             filespec, or a series of filespecs, for arguments.

        Switch Defaults Set by System Manager

             The defaults shown in the list of switches are  correct  for
             most  user  sites.   However, your system manager can change
             some of these default settings.  The changes go into  effect
             during  system  installation.   The  switches  most commonly
             affected are:  /CARDS, /FEET,  /OUTPUT,  /PAGES,  /PRIORITY,
             /TIME, and /TPLOT.

        Disposition of Log Files

             The    three    SUBMIT    command    switches    /BATCH-LOG,
             /LOGDISPOSITION,  and  /OUTPUT,  control what happens to the
             log file of your batch job.


        Where Written

             The log file is always written as the job  runs,  either  to
             the  batch  job's  connected  directory,  or  to a directory
             specified as argument to the  /LOGNAME  switch,  or  to  the
             system's output spooling area (it is written to the spooling
             area only if you give the /BATCH-LOG:SPOOL switch).  If  the
             /DESTINATION-NODE switch is also given, the log file will be
             written into a directory or spooling area at  the  specified
             node.   Remember  that  a batch job's connected directory is
             ordinarily defined to be your  connected  directory  at  the
             time  of  the SUBMIT command; privileged users may specify a
             batch   job's   connected    directory    by    using    the
             /CONNECTED-DIRECTORY switch.

        How Written, When Printed

             The  /BATCH-LOG  switch's  APPEND  and  SUPERSEDE  arguments
             describe  the manner in which the log file is to be written:
             either it is appended to any existing file of the same  name
             (usually produced by a previous running of the batch job) or


                                    393



             it is  written  as  a  new  generation  of  the  file.   The
             /LOGDISPOSITION switch tells the system whether to keep this
             file,  wherever  it  is  written,  once  the  batch  job  is
             finished.   The  /OUTPUT  switch  specifies  when you want a
             listing of the log file to be printed:   either  always,  or
             never,  or  only  if errors occur when the batch job is run.
             By using combinations of these switches you  can  cause  any
             desirable   action.    Giving   /OUTPUT:ALWAYS   along  with
             /LOGDISPOSITION:DELETE allows a record  of  your  batch  job
             with only a temporary use of your disk area, and permits you
             to monitor the progress of the job while it is running (give
             TYPE  commands  to  view the file at your terminal).  Giving
             just the /BATCH-LOG:SPOOL switch allows a record without any
             use  of  your disk area, although then you must wait for the
             printed output to see this record.
*  
*       Execution of Command Files
*  
*            As soon as one of  your  batch  jobs  logs  in,  the  system
*            processes  your  login  directory's  command  files  and the
*            system's command files.  The files  are  processed  in  this
*            order:
*  
*            1.  LOGIN.CMD
*  
*            2.  SYS:LOGIN.CMD
*  
*            3.  BATCH.CMD
*  
*            4.  SYS:BATCH.CMD
*  
*            5.  COMAND.CMD
*  
*            6.  SYS:COMAND.CMD
*

|       Automatic Logout
|  
|            If the batch control file is  not  terminated  by  a  LOGOUT
|            command,  the  batch job is logged-out automatically and the
|            message "KILLED BY OPERATOR TTYnn" is  printed  in  the  log
|            file.


   Hints


        Using SET DEFAULT SUBMIT

             If there are switches that you always or usually supply when
             using  SUBMIT,  give  the  SET  DEFAULT  SUBMIT  command  to
             establish  them  as  defaults  for  the  remainder  of  your


                                    394



             terminal  session.   The switches will then behave as if you
             had typed them directly after  the  word  SUBMIT.   You  can
             supersede   any   of  these  default  switches  by  actually
             supplying the switch, with another value, when you give  the
             SUBMIT command.


                  For Future Terminal Sessions

                       Put SET DEFAULT SUBMIT commands into a file  named
                       COMAND.CMD  or  LOGIN.CMD in your log-in directory
                       if you want these default switches to be in effect
                       for  batch  jobs you submit during future terminal
                       sessions as well.  If both files exist, the system
                       reads LOGIN.CMD first.

                  For Nested Batch Jobs Only

                       Put SET DEFAULT SUBMIT commands into a file  named
                       BATCH.CMD  in  your  log-in  directory if you want
                       them to be in effect  at  the  log-in  time  of  a
                       "nested"  batch  job  only,  that  is, a batch job
                       started by a SUBMIT  command  within  the  control
                       file   of  another  of  your  batch  jobs.   Note,
                       however, that the system also reads COMAND.CMD  at
                       the  log-in time of a batch job if the file exists
                       in your log-in  directory.   It  reads  this  file
                       after BATCH.CMD.

|            Monitoring the Progress of a Batch Job
|  
|                 You can include the SEND command or the  commands  that
|                 run  the MAIL or DECmail/MS mail programs in your batch
|                 control file.  Use these commands to send  messages  to
|                 your terminal informing you of the status of your batch
|                 job.

   Restrictions


        Access Rights for Batch Jobs

             For Specifying Control Files and Log Files

                  You cannot use the ACCESS command to obtain  the  right
                  to submit control files from another directory, because
                  your batch jobs are logged in with rights only to  your


                                    395



                  connected  directory  and  to  directories to which you
                  have access as a group member.  The  control  file,  if
                  not  in  your  connected  directory,  must be in one to
                  which you have read access as a group member;  the  log
                  file  specification,  if you give one, must be for your
                  connected directory or for one to which you have  write
                  access as a group member.

             For Use Within the Batch Job

                  Although it is possible  to  give  CONNECT  and  ACCESS
                  commands  within  a  batch  job to obtain rights beyond
                  those mentioned above, you may  then  have  to  include
                  passwords  in  the  job's  control  file.  Because this
                  practice  could  endanger  system   security,   it   is
                  generally  best  to  establish  and rely on appropriate
                  group rights when preparing batch jobs for submission.

|       PUSH During Batch Job Execution
|  
|            Note  that  a  PUSH  command  reads  the  COMAND.CMD   file.
|            Therefore,  if  your  batch  control  file  contains  a PUSH
|            command, only the defaults set in COMAND.CMD are  in  effect
|            while in the inferior EXEC.
|  
|       Editing a Queued Control File
|  
|       The batch system processes the exact version of the control  file
|       specified  in your SUBMIT command.  Therefore, if you edit a file
|       while it is in the batch queue, the new version of the file  will
|       not be processed.
|  
|       To change the request  to  process  the  latest  version  of  the
|       control file, CANCEL the request and resubmit the job.


   Effect on Memory and Terminal


        The SUBMIT  command  does  not  affect  memory  and  leaves  your
        terminal at TOPS-20 command level.

   Examples


        1.  Submit a control file to begin a batch job.

            @SUBMIT DIFS.CTL
            [Batch job DIFS queued, request-ID 461, limit 0:05:00]
            @

        2.  Submit two control files (specifying only the  filenames)  in
            the  same  command.   then use the information batch-requests
            command (with the user switch) to examine your entries in the
            batch input queue.

        3.  Connect to another user's directory, then submit two  of  his
            control  files.   Prevent  the printing of a log file for one
            job, and allow the second job's to be printed only if  errors
            occur within the job; make both jobs restartable.  Request an
            inclusive listing of your entries in the batch queue - notice
            that  the  jobs  are  logged  in  under  your  own user name,
            although the log files  will  be  stored  in  user  Holland's
            directory.   Note  also  that an asterisk (*) indicates a job
            currently in progress.

            Connect back to your directory and submit  one  of  your  own
            control files, specifying a particular jobname, then check on
            it.

        ALL                  gives all available SYSTAT information

        CLASS                prints the scheduler class in which each job
                             is  running;  the  share  of  total CPU time
                             allotted to the job, expressed as a  decimal
                             fraction; and the fraction of total CPU time
                             actually used by the job.   A  job's  actual
                             use may be larger than its allotted share if
                             some jobs in its class are inactive; it  can
                             be   larger   still  if  other  classes  are
                             inactive and this  unused  fraction  of  CPU
                             time is being allocated among active jobs.

        CONTROLLING          prints, in the column headed CJB, the number
                             of  the controlling job (if any), that is, a
                             job  owning  a  PTY  (pseudo-terminal)  that
                             controls  the job being described; when used
                             in a SYSTAT command requesting  descriptions
                             of  particular  jobs, this subcommand causes
                             jobs  controlled  by  these   jobs   to   be
                             described also.

        DIRECTORY            requests the name of the directory to  which
                             each  job  is  connected,  if  not the job's
                             log-in directory

   Output


        Sample of SYSTAT Output

|            The SYSTAT  command  prints  on  your  terminal  columns  of
             information  about  all  the jobs on the system.  Below is a
             sample of the output you would  receive  in  response  to  a
             SYSTAT  command  that  eliminates  the two rightmost columns
             (User and <Directory>):

               .    .    .      .      .        .      .    .      .

             First  you  see  the  current  date  and  time  (in  24-hour
             notation:   the  sample  above was obtained 37 seconds after
             3:48 P.M.), and the length of  time  since  the  system  was
             started (here, just over 1 hour).

             The second line displays the number of user  jobs  (45)  and
             operator  jobs  (11)  currently  running.   The  next  three
             numbers are the "load averages" for the system:   these  are
             weighted averages of the number of runnable processes on the
             system over the last minute,  5  minutes,  and  15  minutes,
             respectively.   (If  class  scheduling is enabled, the three
             load averages are the average number of jobs having at least
             one  runnable  process, and apply to the class in which your
             job is running.)  If you are about to start a job  requiring
             5  minutes  of CPU time, and the load average remains stable


                                    403



             over the period in question, i.e., becomes 4.54 (3.54 + your
             job  = 4.54), then you can count on your job's getting about
             1/4.54 of your class's share of the system's attention.   If
             your  class  is  assigned one third of the system's CPU time
             and you do not receive any windfall  (unclaimed  CPU  time),
             your job will be finished in a little over one hour.

             After this comes the line of headings labeling  each  column
             of  data  that  follows.   All  but the User and <Directory>
             columns  of  information  appear  in   the   sample   above,
             describing  all  jobs (rows).  The unmodified command SYSTAT
*            displays the Job, Line, Program, User  and  Origin  columns.
             By   using   appropriate  subcommands  you  can  select  the
             categories of information, as well  as  the  specific  jobs.
             (The  Class  (Cls) and Share (Shr) categories appear only if
             class scheduling is enabled.)  User jobs,  both  timesharing
             and  batch,  are  listed  first  (in  ascending order by job
             number), and then, after a blank line, operator  jobs.   The
             number of the job attached to your own terminal appears with
             an asterisk (*) next to it in the Job column.


        Sending Output Elsewhere

             By giving  the  OUTPUT  subcommand  you  can  direct  SYSTAT
             information  to  a  file  instead  of to your terminal.  The
             subcommand LPT sends the information  to  the  line  printer
             instead of to your terminal.


   Characteristics


        Log-in Not Necessary

             You do not have to be logged in to give the SYSTAT command.


   Hints


        Reducing Charges for SYSTAT

             You can use subcommands to restrict the  jobs  surveyed  and
             the  information  requested;  this  will reduce the CPU time
             needed to process the command.  If you decide to cut off the
             SYSTAT  output before it is done, give CTRL/Cs rather than a
             CTRL/O.  This stops not only the output  but  also  the  CPU
             charges for producing it.

        Giving Subcommands as Arguments on the Command Line



                                    404



             To simplify  your  typing,  SYSTAT  accepts  subcommands  as
             arguments  given on the same line as the command, subject to
             these rules:

                  There will be  no  @@  prompt:   simply  type  a  space
                  between  successive  subcommands and between subcommand
                  names and arguments.

                  To get information  about  one  or  more  specific  job
                  numbers, give the numbers only; do not type JOB.

                  To get information about  one  or  more  specific  user
                  names,  give  the names only; do not type USER.  But if
                  the user name is by coincidence the same  as  a  SYSTAT
                  command  argument,  you must use the subcommand mode to
                  request information about his job.

                  To get information about one or  more  specific  log-in
                  directories, give the directory names.[2]

                  To get information about your own (attached) job  only,
                  give a period (.) as argument.

                  To get information about all other jobs logged in under
                  your  user  name,  give  your  user  name  and NO .  as
                  arguments.

                  The system will not accept  the  OUTPUT  subcommand  in
                  this format; use the subcommand mode instead.


   Special Cases


        OPERATOR as a User Name

             You can request or refuse information about operator jobs by
             treating  OPERATOR as a user name.  The system accepts these
             commands:

                  @SYSTAT OPERATOR

             and

                  @SYSTAT,
                  @@USER OPERATOR

             as well as the special commands
    [2]  ^1 For specific connected  directories,  specify  the  directory
         names  (and  structures, if not the public structure) along with
         either the ALL or DIRECTORY subcommand.

   Effect on Memory and Terminal


        The SYSTAT  command  does  not  affect  memory  and  leaves  your
        terminal at TOPS-20 command level.

                                  will then be required.

   Output


        The output from a TAKE command consists of the  output  for  each
        command  in the command file you specify as argument, followed by
        the message, End of filespec, that indicates successful execution
        of all the commands in this file.


   Characteristics

        Running Programs From a Command File

             If you put commands that run programs  (including  the  PUSH
             command)  into  a  command  file, and these programs ask for
             arguments, you must be ready to type in these  arguments  at
             your  terminal.  Only TOPS-20 commands and command arguments
             can be put into a command file executed by the TAKE command.


   Hints

        Suppressing the Final Message

             If you want to suppress the final message (of the form,  End
             of  filespec)  that  indicates  successful  execution  of  a
             command file by TAKE, give a TAKE command with no  arguments
             as the last line of your command file.




                                    410



   Special Cases

        Nested TAKE Commands

             In the case of nested TAKE commands (those given as commands
             within   command  files),  the  destination  for  output  of
             commands given in an inner command file will default to that
             specified or assumed for the output of commands given in the
             nearest surrounding command file.

   Effect on Memory and Terminal

        The TAKE command affects memory and your  terminal  according  to
        the commands stored in the command file you specify as argument.

   TALK



|  Allows you to converse with other users on your system by linking your
|  terminals.


   Format


         TALK      argument        @TALK (TO) argument

        where

|       argument     is a user name or terminal line number


   Characteristics


|       Typing TALK Conversation
|  
|            During a TALK session, you must tell the  system  to  regard
|            your   conversation  as  comments.   Otherwise,  the  system
|            interprets your input as attempts to give EXEC commands  and
|            responds  with the message ?Unrecognized command.  To signal
|            your input as comments, begin each line with the exclamation
|            point  (!)  or semicolon (;) comment character.  Or, if your
|            comment is several lines long, use the REMARK command.


        Other Job Not Affected

             As  soon  as  you  give  a  successful  TALK  command,  both
             terminals  begin  printing  both users' input as well as the
             system's responses to that input.  Each job,  however,  will
             receive input from its own terminal only.

        Ending TALK

             To end a conversation link between  terminals,  either  user
             can give the BREAK command.

        Refused TALK

|            Terminals can be set to refuse links  with  other  terminals
|            with  the  REFUSE LINKS or TERMINAL INHIBIT command.  If you
|            attempt to TALK to a user who has refused links from another
|            terminal,  the  system rings the bells on both terminals six
|            times, and then prints the message, ?Refused, Send  mail  to
|            user   instead.   If  the  user  has  refused  all  terminal


                                    413



|            communication with the TERMINAL INHIBIT command, the  system
|            does not ring the bell on his terminal.

             If you have Wheel or Operator capabilities enabled, you  can
             talk to any user.

        Maximum of Four Terminals

             By using TALK commands you can join up to four terminals  at
             once for sharing displays or printout.


   Hints


        Signaling a Linked User

             Once you have established links with another user's terminal
             via  the TALK command, you can get his attention by typing a
             series of CTRL/Gs.  Depending on the  kind  of  terminal  he
             has,   these   will   be  reproduced  as  ringing  bells  or
             high-pitched beeps.  This action can  be  especially  useful
             when   establishing  links  with  the  owner  of  a  display
             terminal,  as  display  terminals  are  silent  in  ordinary
             operation.


   Special Cases


        User Has More Than One Job

             If more than one job is logged in under the  user  name  you
             specify,  the  system  responds  with  a list of that user's
             terminal line numbers and the programs being run.  Type your
|            choice  of  terminal  line  number  (if  available,  the one
|            running the EXEC) after the TTY:  prompt.

        Talking to a Batch Job or PTYCON Job

             When you link to a PTY  (pseudo-terminal)  to  talk  to  the
             owner  of  a batch job or PTYCON job, the system informs you
             of this with a message, to  which  you  must  reply  with  a
             carriage  return  to confirm the link.  To decline the link,
             give a CTRL/C.  See also Warning, Talking to  a  Batch  Job,
             below.


   Warning


        Talking to a Batch Job


                                    414



             Use   caution   when    communicating    through    a    PTY
             (pseudo-terminal)  that  is controlling a batch job:  do not
             send a question mark (?) or percent sign (%), because  these
             characters  can be attributed to errors occurring within the
             job.  Also, if an error actually does occur in the batch job
             and  the  batch system's question mark is displaced (by your
             remarks) from the beginning of a line, the  system  may  not
             recognize it as an error.

        Talking Between a VT100 and a VT52

             If links between VT100 and VT52  terminals  are  established
             using  a  TALK  (or  ADVISE)  command, the VT52 may function
             improperly during or after the  linked  interval  (e.g.,  by
             requiring  frequent  CTRL/Q commands to print multiple lines
             of output).  Turning the terminal  off  and  then  on  again
             (after the linked interval) will correct this problem.


   Effect on Memory and Terminal


        The TALK command does not affect memory and leaves your  terminal
        at TOPS-20 command level.


   Related Commands


        ADVISE              for sending commands to another user's job

|                           mail.


   Examples

   TDIRECTORY



   The TDIRECTORY (Time-ordered DIRECTORY) command is equivalent  to  the
|  DIRECTORY  command  with the subcommands CHRONOLOGICAL WRITE, REVERSE,
|  and TIMES (AND DATES OF) WRITE.  Use the same format  and  subcommands
   with  TDIRECTORY  as with DIRECTORY.  For further information, see the
   DIRECTORY command description in this manual.

   When used with magnetic tapes, the TDIRECTORY command is equivalent to
   DIRECTORY for magnetic tapes.


   Examples


        1.  Give a TDIRECTORY command, truncating output  with  a  CTRL/C
            after the first few (most recent) files are displayed.

            @TDIRECTORY

                            Write

   TERMINAL



   Sets the characteristics of your terminal.


   Format


         TERMINAL                   argument|       @TERMINAL (FEATURE or TYPE) argument

        where

        argument     is  a  keyword,  chosen   from   the   list   below,
                     representing   your   choice   of  TERMINAL  command
                     options; some arguments further  require  a  decimal
                     number to complete their meaning.


        Summary of TERMINAL Command Arguments (defaults in boldface)

|  The TERMINAL  command  arguments  are  divided  into  two  categories,
|  feature   and   type.    Feature  arguments  set  individual  terminal
|  characteristics and type arguments set a group of characteristics that
|  are defined for the model of your terminal.

        FLAG                instructs  the  system  to  print  a   single
                            quotation   mark  (')  before  it  prints  an
                            uppercase character.  This takes effect  only
                            if you set the NO LOWERCASE parameter.

        FORMFEED            informs the system that your terminal  has  a
                            form  feed  mechanism;  otherwise, the system
                            simulates form feeds by printing the  correct
                            number  of  line  feeds  (set by the TERMINAL
                            LENGTH command) if you have set  TERMINAL  NO
                            INDICATE,  or  by  printing an ^L if you have
                            set TERMINAL INDICATE.

        FULLDUPLEX          instructs the system to send to your terminal
                            each character as the program reads it.  Your
                            terminal does not print what you  type  until
                            the  system  sends  the character back to the
                            terminal.  See also IMMEDIATE.
                                 Default                                 Default

        HALFDUPLEX          inhibits the  system  from  sending  to  your
                            terminal  each  character,  and  assumes that
                            your terminal prints each  character  itself;
                            causes  echoing  of format control characters
                            (for example, TAB and line  feed).   Be  sure
                            also   to   set   any   corresponding  switch
                            physically located on your terminal.

        HELP                prints   information   about   the   TERMINAL
                            command.

        IMMEDIATE           instructs the system to echo  each  character
                            as  soon  as  you type it, instead of waiting
                            until the  program  receives  the  character.
                            Immediate  echoing  has  effect only when the
                            FULLDUPLEX parameter is also set.

        INDICATE            instructs the system to print a ^L instead of
                            advancing the proper number of lines whenever
                            encountering a form  feed  or  CTRL/L  (ASCII
                            character 14).
                                 Default                                 Default

|       INHIBIT             instructs the system not  to  receive  links,
|                           advice,  system  messages, and user messages.
|                           Also stops beep or bell  signals  from  users
|                           attempting  to  TALK  to your terminal.  Only
|                           output from your own job is displayed on your
|                           terminal.  This command disables the settings
|                           established  with  the  RECEIVE  and   REFUSE
|                           commands.  Reestablish the RECEIVE and REFUSE
|                           settings with NO INHIBIT.

        LENGTH n            sets the number  of  lines  printed  on  each
                            page.     (If   you   have   TERMINAL   PAUSE
                            END-OF-PAGE set as  well,  the  system  stops
                            after  printing  n  lines  and continues only
                            when you type CTRL/Q.) If you  set  the  page
                            length  to  0, the system stops printing only
                            when you type CTRL/S  (as  long  as  TERMINAL
                            PAUSE COMMAND is in effect also); it does not
                            automatically stop at the end of a page.
                                 Default                                 Default n - 66

        LINE-HALFDUPLEX     inhibits the  system  from  sending  to  your
                            terminal  each  character,  and  assumes that
                            your terminal prints each  character  itself;
                            does  not  cause  echoing  of  format control
                            characters (for example, TAB and line feed).

        LOWERCASE           tells the system that your  terminal  handles
                            lowercase   output  characters  properly,  by
                            printing either the  lowercase  character  or
                            the  corresponding uppercase character.  When
                            NO LOWERCASE  is  set,  the  system  converts
                            lowercase    output    characters    to   the
                            appropriate   uppercase   characters   before
                            sending  them.   See  also the FLAG and RAISE

        PAGE n              instructs the system to stop printing when it
                            reaches the end of a page, or when you type a
                            CTRL/S.  Continue  the  output  by  typing  a
                            CTRL/Q.   To  set  the  page length, give the
                            number n or give a TERMINAL  LENGTH  command.
                            If  you  set the page length to 0, the system
                            stops printing only when you type a CTRL/S.

                            (END-OF-PAGE), or whenever  you  type  CTRL/S
                            (COMMAND) or x (CHARACTER).

                            For argument END-OF-PAGE to stop your output,
                            argument COMMAND must also be in effect.  You
                            continue the output by typing CTRL/Q or the y
                            parameter of the CHARACTER argument.

                            For argument CHARACTER to stop  your  output,
                            the COMMAND and END-OF-PAGE arguments must be
                            in effect.  With the CHARACTER argument,  you
                            continue  output  by  typing the y parameter.
                            You can specify x and y in various ways:   as
                            the  octal  ASCII  code  for any character or
                            control key; as  any  printing  character  in
                            double  quotes  (" ");  as the word "control"
                            followed by the printing representation of  a
                            control  character  in double quotation marks
                            (for example, CONTROL "A"); and as  the  word
                            "space"  to  specify  the  space bar.  If you
                            specify x and y to be the  same,  or  if  you
                            omit  y,  you  get  a toggle effect.  You can
                            specify  CTRL/S  and  CTRL/Q  as  x   and   y
                            parameters,   respectively,   only  on  local
                            terminals.  (Network terminal connections  do
                            not  allow  for  CTRL/S and CTRL/Q.) But even
                            some local terminals require that you  select
                            characters  other than CTRL/S and CTRL/Q, for
                            example, the VT125 and  the  VT100  with  the
                            printer port option.

                            The default values for x and y are CTRL/S and
                            CTRL/Q for local terminals, and CTRL/A/CTRL/A
                            for  network  terminals.   You  can   achieve
                            consistency   between   local   and   network
                            terminals by placing the same TERMINAL  PAUSE
                            CHARACTER  command in your LOGIN.CMD files on
                            the various TOPS-20 systems.

                            To set the  page  length,  use  the  TERMINAL
                            LENGTH  command.   If you set the page length
                            to 0, the system stops  sending  output  only
                            when  you  type  CTRL/S or the x parameter of
                            the CHARACTER argument.

|                           the same as the REFUSE command.

        SPEED n1 n2         sets the  baud  rate  at  which  the  TOPS-20
                            monitor   receives   characters   from   your
                            terminal (n1) and sends  characters  to  your

                            corresponding switch  physically  located  on
                            your terminal.

        TABS                informs the system  that  your  terminal  has
|                           mechanical  tab stops.  Causes the TAB key to
|                           advance the cursor according to the tab stops
|                           on  your  terminal.   (Some terminals let you
|                           select tab stops while others have tab  stops
|                           every  eight spaces).  If NO TABS is set, the
|                           system simulates  a  tab  by  printing  eight
|                           spaces.

   Characteristics

        TERMINAL Commands Before Log-in

             You can use TERMINAL commands, after an  initial  CTRL/C  or
             RETURN  but  before  logging  in,  to adjust your terminal's
             characteristics.


   Hints

        Setting Your Terminal's Speed

             If the initial speed setting of your terminal  line  is  not
             what you want but your terminal will function at that speed,
             you can give a TERMINAL SPEED command even before log-in  to
             set the proper value.  If your terminal will not work at the
             initial speed, ask the operator to set an appropriate value.


        Using Split Speeds

             If you have a terminal that allows split speeds, you can set
             the  input and output speeds to different values.  This will
             allow you to take advantage of  fast  system  response,  for
             example,  without providing a needlessly fast input line.  A
             setting of 150 2400 will accomplish  this.   Note  that  you
             cannot  use  split  speeds  on  a terminal that is part of a
             DECSYSTEM-2020 system.  Note also that using split speeds on
             VT100,  VT125,  or  VK100  terminals  may  cause the "smooth
             scrolling" feature to function  improperly.   Refer  to  the
                                                             _____ ______             appropriate  terminal  manual, for example, the VT100 User's
             _____             Guide, for details.


   Special Cases

        Terminal Types and Defaults Peculiar to Your System

             The preceding  pages  describe  terminal  types  and  system
             defaults  as  they  are  shipped  with TOPS-20.  However, by
             making changes  to  the  monitor  and  the  TOPS-20  command
             processor,  your  installation  can  add  different terminal


                                    428



             types and change the default characteristics associated with
             terminals.   Check with your system manager to find out what
             changes, if any, are in effect for your system.

        Terminal Speed Retained from Last Session

             Although most terminal  characteristics  revert  to  default
             settings  when you log in, the terminal line will retain the
             value for speed set by the last user of the line, even if he
             was  using  a  different  kind of terminal.  However, if the
             system failed and was restarted after the terminal line  was
             last  used,  the  initial  speed  will  be determined by the
             appropriate   TERMINAL   SPEED   command   in   the   system
             configuration file.  Also, dial-up lines return to the speed
             specified in this file after every use.


|  Restrictions
|  
|       CTRL/S and CTRL/Q Not Passed to Remote Nodes
|  
|            CTRL/S and CTRL/Q are always processed by  your  host  node;
|            they are not sent to a remote node.  Therefore, when you are
|            connected to a remote node  with  the  SETHOST  program  and
|            TERMINAL  PAUSE  (ON) END-OF-PAGE is set on the remote node,
|            CTRL/Q will not continue scrolling.  CTRL/A is  the  default
|            control  character recognized by the remote node for pausing
|            and continuing scrolling.  You can use  the  TERMINAL  PAUSE
|            (ON)  CHARACTER  command  to  specify the pause and continue
|            characters of your choosing - except CTRL/S and CTRL/Q.   It
|            is  recommended  that you define the same pause and continue
|            scrolling characters on your host and the remote node.
|  
|       Disabling CTRL/S and CTRL/Q on High Speed Terminals
|  
|            Some terminal models, when set to a high receive baud  rate,
|            such  as  9600, require that the CTRL/S and CTRL/Q pause and
|            continue characters be enabled in order to correctly  format
|            terminal output.  If you must disable CTRL/S and CTRL/Q with
|            the TERMINAL NO PAUSE COMMAND, manually set the terminal  to
|            fast or "jump" scroll.  If the output is still not correctly
|            formatted, set a slower receive baud rate with the  TERMINAL
|            SPEED command.  Then, manually set the same baud rate on the
|            terminal.

   Warning


        Setting an Improper Terminal Speed

             If you  set  an  incorrect  speed  for  your  terminal,  for
             example,  one that is too high, you will be unable to use it


                                    429



             further.  A TERMINAL SPEED command in the LOGIN.CMD file  in
             your log-in directory can cause the same problem.  In such a
             case, obtain your terminal  line  number  if  possible  (the
             second  column  of  SYSTAT  command  output consists of line
             numbers) and ask the operator to set an appropriate value.


   Effect on Memory and Terminal

        The TERMINAL command does  not  affect  memory  and  leaves  your
        terminal at TOPS-20 command level.

   Hints


        Using Project-programmer Numbers

             Use project-programmer numbers instead  of  directory  names
             when  giving file specifications to programs written for the
             TOPS-10  operating  system.   These  include  the  assembler
             MACRO;  the FORTRAN, COBOL, and ALGOL compilers; the linking
             loader  LINK;   and   utility   programs   CREF   (providing
             cross-reference   information)  and  FILCOM  (for  comparing
             files).  If you are unsure whether a system program requires
             project-programmer numbers, load it into memory (using the R
             command), give a CTRL/C to return to TOPS-20 command  level,
             and  then  examine  memory with the INFORMATION MEMORY-USAGE
             command.  If the file PA1050.EXE (the TOPS-10  compatibility


                                    432



             package)   is  present  in  memory,  then  the  program  was
             originally  written  for   TOPS-10   and   may   require   a
             project-programmer  number where you would ordinarily give a
             directory name.


        Avoiding Project-programmer Numbers

             To avoid project-programmer numbers, define a  logical  name
             (of  6  or  fewer  characters) as the directory in question.
             Then use this logical name in place of  the  directory  when
             giving  file specifications.  The system program will accept
             the logical name as a device name, and will  then  be  using
             the correct directory.


   Effect on Memory and Terminal


        The TRANSLATE command does not  affect  memory  and  leaves  your
        terminal at TOPS-20 command level.

   Output


        Entire Contents of Files

             In response to the TYPE command the system prints the entire
             contents  of  a  file (up to the EOF (end-of-file) pointer),
             including blank lines and line numbers if there are any.  If
             you  specify  more  than one file, the filespec precedes the
             contents of each file.

             To stop the TYPE command, type two CTRL/Cs.  A  CTRL/O  will
             also  stop  the  output, but will not stop the processing of
             the command or the accumulation of CPU charges.  Note that a
             pair  of  CTRL/Os causes the system to skip over part of the
             output and continue printing.


   Effect on Memory and Terminal


        The TYPE command does not affect memory and leaves your  terminal
        at TOPS-20 command level.

             You do not have  to  be  logged  in  to  give  the  UNATTACH
             command.

   Hints


        Freeing Hung Terminals

             The UNATTACH command is useful for freeing a terminal  that,
             because  of  program  or hardware errors, is no longer under
             control of the user.  The command UNATTACH  n  can  be  more
             effective than LOGOUT n for this purpose.


   Effect on Memory and Terminal


        The UNATTACH command does not affect memory and leaves  your  own
        terminal  at TOPS-20 command level.  The other job is left in its


                                    436



        current state (usually suspended) and the disengaged terminal  is
        left in the state before log-in.

        ATTACH     for joining another job to your terminal

        DETACH     for disengaging your own job from its terminal


   Examples


        1.  Disengage another user's job from its terminal.

            @UNATTACH KANE
            Password:
            @

        2.  From a terminal on which you have not yet logged in, give the
            UNATTACH  command  to  disengage your only logged-in job from
            its terminal.

            @

        3.  Give a SYSTAT command to find out what jobs you have running.
            Give the UNATTACH command for two of them (you must specify a
            job number for the first one so the system  will  know  which
            one you mean), and check them with another SYSTAT command.

   UNDELETE



   Restores deleted files.


   Format


         UNDELETE         filespec,...        @UNDELETE (FILES) filespec,...

        where

        filespec     is the specification of the file you want to restore
                          Default                          Default .gen - all generations of the specified
                                         files

        ,...         means that, after commas, you  can  give  more  file
                     specifications


   Restrictions


        Erasure of Deleted Files

             Ordinarily  an  UNDELETE  command  given  during  the   same
             terminal  session  as  an original deletion will recover the
             deleted files, unless you included the EXPUNGE subcommand to
             DELETE  or  gave  a subsequent EXPUNGE command.  However, if
             any user or a batch job  logs  out  while  connect  to  your
             directory,  all deleted files are permanently erased.  Also,
             if available disk space is low on the system,  the  operator
             or  the  system  itself  may  expunge  all deleted files.  A
             system warning message is usually sent before this happens.


   Special Cases


        Restoring Files Deleted With CONTENTS-ONLY Subcommand.

             Any files deleted by a DELETE command with  a  CONTENTS-ONLY
             subcommand  are  immediately  expunged.   You  must  use the
             RETRIEVE command to restore these to disk.


   Effect on Memory and Terminal


        The UNDELETE command does  not  affect  memory  and  leaves  your


                                    438



        terminal at TOPS-20 command level.

|  
|  Characteristics
|  
|  
|       Unkept Forks
|  
|            An unkept fork is a fork that is cleared  from  memory  when
|            another  program  is  loaded  or  when  the RESET command is
|            given.  Forks are normally unkept unless kept with the  KEEP
|            or SET PROGRAM KEEP commands.
|  
|       Inferior Forks
|  
|            The UNKEEP command simultaneously cancels the kept status of
|            a superior fork and its inferior forks.
|  
|  
|  Hints
|  
|  
|       More Information
|  
|            The UNKEEP command is one of the TOPS-20  multiforking-class
|            commands.   For more information about multiforking, see the
                                                                  _______|            section named  Running  Multiple  Programs  in  the  TOPS-20

|  
|  
|  Effect on Memory and Terminal
|  
|       The UNKEEP  command  does  not  affect  memory  and  leaves  your
|       terminal  at  TOPS-20  command  level.  It does, however, allow a
|       fork in memory to be cleared when another program  is  loaded  or
|       the RESET command is given.

   UNLOAD



   Rewinds a magnetic tape until it is returned completely to the  source
   reel,  and  puts  the associated tape drive off line.  Use UNLOAD only
   for tapes mounted on drives having device names of the form MTAn:.


   Format


         UNLOAD          dev:        @UNLOAD (DEVICE) dev:

        where

        dev:     is the name of the magnetic tape drive that you want  to
                 unload


   Restrictions


        UNLOAD With Open Files

             If you have given a CTRL/C to exit from a program  that  has
             opened  a  magnetic  tape drive and you then gave the UNLOAD
             command for that tape drive, the system will  first  ask  if
             you  want  to close the associated file.  You must do so for
             UNLOAD to succeed,  but  you  will  probably  be  unable  to
             continue  the  program from that point because the file will
             now be closed.


   Warning


        Cannot Access Tape Again

             The UNLOAD command makes it impossible to access  your  tape
             again unless it is reloaded by the operator.


   Effect on Memory and Terminal


        The UNLOAD  command  does  not  affect  memory  and  leaves  your
        terminal at TOPS-20 command level.

   VDIRECTORY



   The VDIRECTORY  (Verbose  DIRECTORY)  command  is  equivalent  to  the
   DIRECTORY command with the subcommands LENGTH, NO HEADING, PROTECTION,
   SIZE, and TIMES (AND  DATES  OF)  WRITE.   Use  the  same  format  and
   subcommands   with   VDIRECTORY   as   with  DIRECTORY.   For  further
   information see the DIRECTORY command description in this manual.

   When used with magnetic tapes, the VDIRECTORY command is equivalent to
   the DIRECTORY command for magnetic tapes.


   Examples


        1.  Give the VDIRECTORY command, then cut off the output  with  a
            CTRL/C.

   These commands allow you to reserve a device prior  to  using  it,  to
   manipulate the device, and to release it once it is no longer needed.

        ASSIGN         Reserves a device for use by your job.

        BACKSPACE      Moves a magnetic tape backward.

        DEASSIGN       Releases a previously assigned device.

        DISMOUNT       Gives up access to the specified structure or tape
                       set.

        EOF            Writes an end-of-file mark on a magnetic tape.

        MOUNT          Requests use of the specified  structure  or  tape
                       set.

        REWIND         Moves a magnetic tape backward to its load point.

        SKIP           Moves a magnetic tape forward.

        UNLOAD         Rewinds a magnetic tape until the  tape  is  wound
                       completely on the source reel.



        PROGRAM CONTROL COMMANDS   A.4  PROGRAM CONTROL COMMANDS

   The following commands help you run and debug your own programs.

        COMPILE        Translates a source program using the  appropriate
                       compiler.

        CONTINUE       Resumes  execution  of  a   program   (e.g.,   one
                       interrupted by a CTRL/C).

        CREF           Runs  the   CREF   program,   which   produces   a
                       cross-reference listing and automatically sends it
                       to the line printer.

        CSAVE          Saves  in  a  compressed  executable  format   the
                       program  currently  in  memory.   (Usually SAVE is
                       better for most purposes.)

   This appendix consists of an alphabetical list of TOPS-20 commands and
   short  descriptions  of  each.   The  varieties  of argument needed to
   complete each command are shown next, in the order that you give them;
   parentheses   indicate  that  the  argument  is  optional  or  can  be
   defaulted.  Last comes the effect of the command  on  memory - whether
   it clears memory (by loading a program or by other means) or otherwise
   alters it, or leaves it unaffected.  Use this appendix along with  the
   question mark and recognition features to refresh your memory once you
   have become familiar with the contents of this manual.

   Note that  you  can  issue  TOPS-20  commands  as  an  alternative  to
   specifying  many  of  the  file  attributes.   For  example,  SET FILE
   PROTECTION, rather than the P attribute, can be used to set  the  file
   protection.   Also,  such  commands  as  INFORMATION  FILE-STATUS  and
   DIRECTORY (with the EVERYTHING subcommand) display your file attribute
   settings.

                             CONTROL CHARACTERS                             CONTROL CHARACTERS



|  This appendix lists the TOPS-20 control characters.  To type a control
|  character,  use  the  CTRL key like the SHIFT key.  Hold down the CTRL
|  key and at the same time type the character key.
|  
|  CTRL
|  CHARACTER                          FUNCTION
|  
|  CTRL/C    Cancels a command when typed during command entry.
|  
|            Cancels command execution when typed  twice  during  command
|            execution.  (The first ^C does not echo.)
|  
|            Halts a program and returns to TOPS-20  command  level  when
|            typed twice during program execution.
|  
|  CTRL/E    Ends an ADVISE command link between two terminals.
|  
|  CTRL/F    Provides  recognition  input  for  file  specifications  and
|            command  names  and  arguments.   Similar to the ESCAPE key,
|            except that it completes only one field at a time with  file
|            specifications  and  it  does  not  supply  guidewords  with
|            commands.
|  
|  CTRL/G    Rings the terminal bell.  Use with SEND and TALK commands to
|            signal another user.
|  
|  CTRL/H    Reprints a command line up to the field that  is  in  error.
|            Type  immediately after the input error message.  Duplicates
|            the function of the BACKSPACE key.
|  
|  CTRL/I    Duplicates the function of the TAB key.
|  
|  CTRL/L    Advances the paper on a hard-copy terminal to the top of the
|            next  page.  To stop the ^L from printing, give the TERMINAL
|            NO INDICATE command.
|  
|  CTRL/O    Stops output to the terminal while the  program  or  command


                                    D-1
                             CONTROL CHARACTERS                             CONTROL CHARACTERS


|            continues to execute.
|  
|            Output resumes when:
|                    another CTRL/O is typed
|                    the program or command finishes
|                    the program prompts for input
|  
|  CTRL/Q    Continues scrolling  terminal  output  that  was  paused  by
|            CTRL/S or a pause on an end of page.  Use the TERMINAL PAUSE
|            (ON)  CHARACTER  command  to  define  alternate  pause   and
|            continue   characters.   Use  the  TERMINAL  NO  PAUSE  (ON)
|            END-OF-PAGE command to stop pause on an end  of  page.   Use
|            the TERMINAL LENGTH command to set the page length.
|  
|  CTRL/R    Reprints  the  current  command   line   incorporating   the
|            corrections  made  with  the  DELETE  key or CTRL/W.  Use on
|            hard-copy terminals when backslashes and underscores  caused
|            by  editing  with  DELETE  and  CTRL/W make the command line
|            difficult to read.  Use on video  terminals  when  a  system
|            message covers the command line.
|  
|  CTRL/S    Pauses scrolling of terminal output until CTRL/Q  is  typed.
|            Input,  though  not  displayed,  is  accepted into the input
|            buffer and processed after a CTRL/Q.  Use the TERMINAL PAUSE
|            (ON)   CHARACTER  command  to  define  alternate  pause  and
|            continue characters.
|
