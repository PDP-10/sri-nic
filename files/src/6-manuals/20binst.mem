   This manual is for the person who has the responsibility to:

        1.  Install the TOPS-20 software on a new DECSYSTEM-20.

        2.  Update  the  TOPS-20   software   system   on   an   existing
            DECSYSTEM-20.

   To use this  manual  effectively,  first  read  Getting  Started  With
   TOPS-20.   You should also become familiar with the information in the
   TOPS-20 User's Guide and the TOPS-20 Operator's Guide.

   You do not have to know assembly language programming or have previous
   experience  installing  a  TOPS-20  software system, although both are
   helpful.


                          Contents of This Manual                          Contents of This Manual

   Chapters 1 through 7 contain  step-by-step  instructions,  with  error
|  recovery  procedures,  describing how to install a new TOPS-20 Version
|  6.0 software system.

   Appendix A contains step-by-step instructions describing how to update
|  a TOPS-20 Version 5 software system to Version 6.0.

   After you complete either the set of steps in Chapters 1 through 7  or
   the steps in Appendix A, your system is ready for timesharing.

   Appendix  B  is  a  pocket  installation  guide  for  the  experienced
   installer.   This  appendix contains the text and output from a sample
   installation, but does not cover error recovery procedures.  The steps
   in  this appendix are keyed to the body of this manual so that you can
   easily refer to a complete description of any step.

   Appendix C describes the procedures for tailoring your system for  the
   ARPA network.

   Appendix D contains the procedures for generating a tailored batch and
   spooling system (GALAXY).

   The  commands  you  must  type  are  printed  in  RED.   If  you  type
   accurately,  all  you have to do is perform the indicated function and
   verify that your actual terminal output resembles the  sample  output.
   Remember  that systems differ in memory size and peripherals, so steps
   that describe configuring memory, initializing line printers and  disk
   packs,  and  assigning logical unit numbers to tape drives require you
   to type the values that are correct for your system and not the sample
   parameters.


                                     6



   If your terminal output does not resemble  the  sample  output,  first
   read  ALL  the  instructions  after  the word "Error", then choose the
   recovery procedure that corrects your problem.

                                    NOTE

           The version and edit  numbers  in  this  manual  could
           differ  from  the  numbers  printed  on  your  console
           terminal.  The numbers printed on your console must be
           equal to or greater than the numbers in this manual.

                                                _____   Time estimates are included so that you know about  how  long  a  step
   takes.  Times are estimated to the nearest minute, so don't worry if a
   step takes somewhat longer or shorter than this.

   Checking off each step as you complete it is a good way to  keep  your
   place.

                                INTRODUCTION                                INTRODUCTION


   The TOPS-20 System Manager's Guide contains helpful hints  on  how  to
   manage  a  TOPS-20  timesharing  system.  A system manager should read
   this manual before making timesharing generally available to users.

                                    NOTE

           Before starting the  installation,  read  the  listing
           labeled  TOPS20.BWR,  which accompanies your software.
           The TOPS20.BWR file describes changes in the  software
           made too late for inclusion in this manual.



   1.2  PREPARING FOR INSTALLATION   1.2  PREPARING FOR INSTALLATION

   A DIGITAL Field Service Representative will install your  DECSYSTEM-20
   hardware  and  inform  you when the system runs diagnostics correctly.
   Before he leaves, obtain the following information:

        1.  The channel, unit, and controller number of each disk  drive,
            and  whether  it  is  dual-ported.  The controller number for
            RP04, RP06, and RP07 is -1.  The  controller  number  for  an
            RA60  and  RA81  is  7.   RP20  disk  drives have a different
            controller number.The unit number is located on  the  display
            panel on the drive.  The DECSYSTEM-20 dual-ported disk drives
            are connected to both the CPU and  the  front-end  processor.
            It  is  an error if two dual-ported drives with the same unit
            number  are  connected  to  the  front-end  processor.    The
            procedures  in  this manual assume that the unit on which you
            are installing the front-end software is Unit 0.

                    The serial numbers on TU70 and/or  TU71  tape
                    drives  are  made up of three factors.  These
                    factors consist of the RH20  channel  number,
                    the  DX20  number,  and a two-digit tape unit
                    number.   Assuming  that  the  RH20   channel
                    number  is 2, the serial number for tape unit
                    3 would be as follows:

                         2003

                    In the above example, the RH20 channel is the
                    first  digit  (2),  the  DX20  number  is the
                    second digit (0), and the last two digits are
                    the tape unit number (03).  The serial number
                    for a TU72 tape drive can  be  found  on  the
                    back of the tape drive.

   2.1.1  Preparing the DECSYSTEM-20 for Installation   2.1.1  Preparing the DECSYSTEM-20 for Installation

   Prepare the system for installation by powering it up and mounting the
   disk packs.


   Step 1:  Read the Listing Labeled TOPS20.BWR.   Step 1:  Read the Listing Labeled TOPS20.BWR.

   Read the listing labeled TOPS20.BWR to  learn  about  any  last-minute
   changes made to the installation procedure or to the TOPS-20 software.


   Step 2:   Ask Your DIGITAL Field Service Representative  if  the  Disk   Step 2:   Ask Your DIGITAL Field Service Representative  if  the  Disk
             Packs Are Formatted.             Packs Are Formatted.

   Ask your DIGITAL Field Service Representative if the  disk  packs  are
   formatted  for use with the DECSYSTEM-20.  If they are not, ask him to
   format them.  You cannot use the RP20 for the system  structure.   The
   packs must be formatted before you proceed further.


   Step 3:  Power Up the System.   Step 3:  Power Up the System.

   Turn on the power by pressing the POWER switch if the light under  the
   word  POWER  on  the  operator's  panel  is  off.   (Do  not touch the
   emergency power switch unless you see smoke or sparks coming from  the
   system.)  The system is ready after a few seconds, and the power light
   comes on.

   Be sure that the system is completely powered on:

        1.  Check the disk drives.

        2.  Check the magnetic tape drives.  If power is off,  press  the
            rocker  switch,  i.e., the white switch containing the ON/OFF
            light, on the front panel.  If you have trouble with the disk
            drives  or  magnetic  tape  drives,  call  your DIGITAL Field
            Service Representative for assistance.

        3.  Check the line printers.  If power is off  for  an  LP20A  or
            LP20B printer (which has four buttons on the right of the top
            panel), reset the knee-level breaker on the lower panel.  The
            TAPE  light may be on; disregard it.  If you have an LP20F or
            LP20H printer (which has four rocker switches on the left  of
            the  top  panel),  lift  the  cover just above the lights and
            reset the breaker.  Be sure that the printer has paper.

        4.  Turn on the console terminal.  Be sure that it is on line and
            has paper.


   Step 4:  Label the Disk Packs.   Step 4:  Label the Disk Packs.

   This manual contains the procedures for creating the system  structure
   for  your  system.   The  system  structure  name  can  be  up  to six
   characters and contains the files  needed  to  run  the  system.   The
   system  structure  cannot  include  RP20  disk  drives.  If the system
   structure is on an RP07 disk drive, the  front-end  file  system  must
   reside  on  a  RP04  or  RP06 dual-ported disk drive.  Decide how many
   packs you  will  have,  and  assign  them  consecutive  "logical  unit
   numbers,"  starting  with  0.   These  are  the  logical  pack numbers
   referred to in Step 25.

   Identify each pack by writing these numbers with a felt-tip pen on the
   pack  cover  with a gummed label.  A sample of the format of the label
   is:

        TOPS-20 Disk Pack
        Structure ID:  structure name
        Logical Unit:  n

                                  CAUTION

           __ ___ ___ _ ______ _____ __ ___ _______ __  ___  ____           Do not use a gummed label on the surface of  the  pack
           ______           itself,  because  it  can  spin  off  and cause severe
           damage to the drive.


   Step 5:  Mounting an RP04 or RP06 Disk Pack.   Step 5:  Mounting an RP04 or RP06 Disk Pack.

   Mount the disk packs on the proper drives.  RP04 and RP06  disk  packs
   are similar in appearance but can be distinguished by the name RP04 or
   RP06 written on the upper surface of the pack.  Make  sure  you  place
   one  pack  on  the drive that is unit 0, dual ported, and connected to
   the front-end.  The installation procedure stores the  files  used  by
   the  front-end  on this pack.  After the installation is complete, you
   may dismount the disk packs so that the  drives  can  be  cleaned  and
   maintained.   However, during system operation, the pack that contains
   the front-end files must be on dual-ported drive 0 as  it  was  during
   installation.

   Be careful when mounting a disk pack because the drive  shaft  can  be
   damaged if the pack is jammed off center into the drive.  Follow these
   instructions when mounting a pack:

                                    NOTE

           RP07 and RP20 disk packs are non-removable.  To  mount
           an RA60 disk pack refer to the HSC-50 User's Guide.

        1.  If another RP04 or RP06 disk is already mounted on the  drive
            and  spinning, press the START/STOP button and wait until the
            drive stops.

        2.  Push the door back; slide the pack cover down over the pack.

        3.  Turn the cover handle counterclockwise a few turns  until  it
            turns  freely.  Gently lift the pack vertically.  If there is
            any  resistance,  turn  the   handle   a   few   more   turns
            counterclockwise and lift again.

        4.  Lift the pack out of the drive and place it on the protective
            bottom cover.  Be sure that the cover clicks closed.

        5.  Pick up the pack to be  mounted  and  remove  the  protective

            properly.)

       10.  Be sure that the drive is not write  protected.   The  switch
            labeled WRITE PROTECT must be off.

                                  CAUTION

           Do not leave a disk pack or magnetic tape on top of  a
           disk  drive.   The  vibration from the drive can cause
           these items to fall to the  floor,  causing  expensive
           and irreparable damage.


   Step 6:  Check the CONTROLLER SELECT Switches.   Step 6:  Check the CONTROLLER SELECT Switches.

   and mount the tape on drive 0.  Drive 0 is  the  lowest  unit  on  the
   lowest channel on the lowest TM03, TM02 controller or DX20 controller.
   Your DIGITAL Field Service Representative gives you this  information.
   If  you  cannot  determine  which drive is drive 0, make sure that all
   drives are off line except the one you want to use.

                                    NOTE

           Be  sure  to  mount  the  correct   version   of   the
           Installation  tape.   Refer  to Chapter 1, Section 1.3
           for the correct Installation tape for your system.

                                  CAUTION

           The logical unit number for a magnetic tape  drive  is
           ___           not  determined by the numbered thumbwheel on the left
           side of TU45 drives.  The numbered thumbwheel  is  the
           slave  number  of the drive.  Never change the setting
           of this thumbwheel.

   To mount a reel of tape on a TU45 tape drive:

        1.  Place the reel on the top hub with the labeled  side  of  the

        5.  Press the LOAD button.  The tape  slowly  advances  onto  the
            take-up  reel and moves to the logical beginning of the tape.
            If the  drive  overshoots  the  beginning  of  the  tape,  it
            repositions itself.

        6.  Make sure the ON LINE button is lit; if it is not, press  the
            ON LINE button.

   To mount a reel of tape on a TU77 or TU78 tape drive:

        1.  Place the reel of tape on the top hub with the  labeled  side
            of the tape facing you.

        2.  Lock the reel on the hub by pressing the rocker in the center
            of the hub.

        3.  Press, in order, the RESET and LOAD  buttons.   The  tape  is
            wound  counterclockwise a few turns.  Then the tape leader is
            threaded  automatically  through  the  slot  near  the  upper
            right-hand corner of the drive, and the tape is positioned at
            the logical beginning of tape.

        4.  Press the ON LINE button.

   On completion, the LOAD, ON LINE, and FILE PROTECT (FPT) lights should
   be  on, indicating that the tape is positioned at the beginning.  When
   the FILE PROTECT light is on, the system cannot write on the tape.  If
   the  FILE PROTECT light is not on, remove the write ring from the back
   of the tape.

   To mount a reel of tape on a TU72 tape drive:

        1.  Place the reel of tape on the rightmost hub with the  labeled
            side of the tape facing you.

        2.  Thread  the  tape  leader  down  the   slot   until   it   is
            approximately three inches in front of the read/write head.

        3.  Press, in order, the RESET, LOAD,  and  START  buttons.   The
            tape leader is threaded automatically on the take-up reel and
            the tape is positioned at the logical beginning of tape.



   2.1.2  Loading and Starting the TOPS-20 Monitor   2.1.2  Loading and Starting the TOPS-20 Monitor

   To create the TOPS-20 file  system,  you  need  to  load  the  TOPS-20
   monitor  into  the  system  and  start  the file system initialization
   routine.  Perform steps 10 through 19 to load and  start  the  TOPS-20
   monitor.

        1.  Load the front-end monitor from the floppy  disks.   Use  the
            front end to initialize the central processor and memory.

        2.  Use the front-end monitor to load the TOPS-20  Magnetic  Tape
            Bootstrap  (MTBOOT)  program  from  System  Floppy A into the
            central processor.

        3.  Use MTBOOT to load the TOPS-20  monitor  from  magnetic  tape
            into memory.

        4.  Use MTBOOT to start the TOPS-20 monitor at  the  file  system
            initialization routine.

   Step 10:  Place the Front-End HALT Switch in the ENABLE Position.   Step 10:  Place the Front-End HALT Switch in the ENABLE Position.

   Open the second door from the left side of the DECSYSTEM-20,  directly
   under   the  DECSYSTEM-20  control  panel,  to  access  the  front-end
   switches.

   Be sure that the front-end HALT  switch  is  in  the  ENABLE  position
   (Figure  2-1).   If  the switch is in the HALT position, move it up to
   the ENABLE position.  When the HALT switch is in  the  HALT  position,
   the front end will not operate.


   Step 11:  Set the Switch Register to 000007 (octal).   Step 11:  Set the Switch Register to 000007 (octal).

   The front-end control panel has 16 switch  register  switches  (Figure
   2-1).   Set them to 000007 (octal) by setting switches 2, 1, and 0 up,
   and leaving the rest down.  (Refer to Part 4, Chapter 1 of the TOPS-20
   Operator's Guide for a detailed description of all switches.)

   Booting the front end from a floppy disk with the switch register  set
   to  000007  causes  the front-end monitor to run the central processor
   initialization dialog.  This loads the central processor microcode and
   configures central processor memory.


   Step 12:  Hold ENABLE and Press the SWITCH REGISTER Button.   Step 12:  Hold ENABLE and Press the SWITCH REGISTER Button.

   Hold ENABLE and press the SWITCH REGISTER button on the control  panel
   (Figure  2-1);  this  loads  the  front-end  monitor  and  starts  the
   initialization dialog.  The system prints:

   To initialize the TOPS-20 file system, you must define the name of the
   system structure and the number and location of each disk pack that is
   part of the system structure.

   The steps in this  section  initialize  the  TOPS-20  file  system  by
   creating:

        1.  New home blocks (which contain pointers to the  beginning  of
            the file system).

        2.  The directory <ROOT-DIRECTORY> (which  contains  pointers  to
            all the directories in the system).

        3.  The    directories    <SYSTEM>,    <SUBSYS>,    <NEW-SYSTEM>,
            <NEW-SUBSYS>,  <UETP>,  <UETP.LIB>,  <UETP.RUN>,  <ACCOUNTS>,
            <SYSTEM-ERROR>, <OPERATOR>, and <SPOOL>.

   The system prints the message <SYSTEM>ACCOUNTS-TABLE.BIN NOT  FOUND  -
   ACCOUNT VALIDATION IS DISABLED because the ACTGEN program has not been
   run.  (Refer to Chapter 6 of the TOPS-20 System  Manager's  Guide  for
   more  information.)   The  system  prints NO SYSJOB because the SYSJOB
   program is not stored on disk.  This program is  not  needed  yet,  so
   ignore this message.

        MX>

   Error:    If you get another error in the form INTERRUPT AT  location,
             the  tape  could  be  bad or you may be specifying the wrong
             tape drive.  Start at Step 10  once  more.   If  the  errors
             continue, call DIGITAL Software Support.

             If you make a typing mistake and press the RETURN  key,  the

   Error:    If the system prints INTERRUPT AT 1, you typed  only  one  G
             command  to  the miniexec.  Repeat the command in this step.
             If you still get the error, go back  to  Step  12.   If  the
             errors continue, contact DIGITAL Software Support.

             If you receive the error message INTERRUPT AT 601772, follow
             the error recovery procedures listed below.

             Rewind the tape manually and give the following commands:

                  MX>GET FILE MTA0:<RET>
                  MX>RESET<RET>
                  MX>GET FILE MTA0:<RET>
                  MX>START<RET>

             Proceed to Step 43.

             If you make a typing error and press  the  RETURN  key,  the
             system prints the MX> prompt.  Try again.

   Error:    If many error messages  are  repeatedly  printed,  the  tape
             could  be bad.  Press the front-end HALT switch and wait one
             minute.  Go back to Step 12.  If the errors persist, ask for
             another tape.

   2.6  RESTORING TOPS-20 BUNDLED SOFTWARE FROM TAPE   2.6  RESTORING TOPS-20 BUNDLED SOFTWARE FROM TAPE

   Restore the files for the directories  PS:<SYSTEM>,  PS:<SUBSYS>,  and
   PS:<UETP.LIB> from the tape.

   Give the DUMPER command FILES just before the RESTORE command  if  you
   want  the  system  to  print  the  file  specification of each file it
   restores.   The  installation  takes  longer   if   you   print   this
   information.   To  stop  printing each file specification, give the NO
   FILES command after the current RESTORE command finishes.

   (Refer to Chapter 7  of  the  TOPS-20  User  Utilities  Guide  for  an
   explanation of any messages that DUMPER may print on your terminal.)

                            TAILORING THE SYSTEM                            TAILORING THE SYSTEM



   After you  have  installed  the  bundled  TOPS-20  software  from  the
   Installation  Tape,  tailor  your system for your specific needs.  You
   must:

        1.  Select a monitor that is correct for your system.

        2.  Change the system name.

        3.  Set terminal speeds;  define  remote  lines,  system  logical
            names,   magnetic   tape   drive   parameters,  line  printer
            parameters, time zone, file archiving and  migration  recycle
            periods,  and  accounting  shift  parameters;  and  enable or
            disable  directory  parameter  setting,  account  validation,
            class scheduling, working set swapping, latency optimization,
            and tape drive allocation.  All these parameters are  located
|           in the system parameter file PS:<SYSTEM>6-CONFIG.CMD.

        4.  Change the operator's password and user group.

        5.  Create the directory PS:<REMARKS>.

        6.  Create the PS:<SYSTEM>LPFORM.INI file.



   3.1  SELECTING A TOPS-20 MONITOR   3.1  SELECTING A TOPS-20 MONITOR

   At this time you are running the TOPS-20 monitor 2060-MONBIG.EXE.  You
   should  now  select  the monitor that most closely meets your system's
   requirements.  Choose a monitor that supports at least:

        1.  As much memory as  your  system  contains.   A  monitor  that
            supports  less  memory than your system contains will not use
            all available memory.

        2.  The number of terminal lines you  need.   Do  not  count  the
            operator's  console  in  this  number.   Just count the local
            terminal lines and remote lines.

        3.  The number of user jobs that you plan to run, plus  two  (one
            operator  job  and job 0).  For example, if you expect to run
            20 user jobs, the monitor you select should support at  least
            22 jobs.

        4.  The number of pseudo-terminals that  you  need.   The  system
            needs  at  least  two pseudo-terminals, one to run the PTYCON
            program, which in turn usually runs the operator program OPR,
            and  one  for  unplanned  situations  that  may  arise.   For
            example, if you want to run  five  pseudo-terminals  in  your
            batch system, you need a monitor that supports at least seven
            pseudo-terminals.

        5.  The number of peripheral devices on your system.

   All monitors are stored in  the  directory  <SYSTEM>.   They  all  run
   timesharing  and batch concurrently.  Do not select a monitor that has
   fewer resources than you need, or  a  monitor  that  is  unnecessarily
   large.   The  TOPS-20  monitors  and  their characteristics are listed
   below.  Refer to Table 3-1 for the maximum structure size.

   3.2  CHANGING THE SYSTEM NAME   3.2  CHANGING THE SYSTEM NAME

   Whenever  a  user  types  CTRL/C  before  logging  in  or  gives   the
   INFORMATION  (ABOUT)  VERSION  command,  the  system  prints a message
   similar to:

|       TOPS-20 SMALL SYSTEM, TOPS-20 MONITOR 6.(5050)

   You can change the system name "TOPS-20 SMALL SYSTEM" by entering  the
   name  you  want  into  the  file  PS:<SYSTEM>MONNAM.TXT.   If the name
   contains lowercase letters, give the command  TERMINAL  (MODE  IS)  NO
   RAISE before entering the name.

   The text of the system name can contain up  to  105  characters.   For
   practical  purposes,  it  should  not exceed 32 characters to fit on a
   single 72-character line of terminal output.  The following two  steps
   show how to change the system name to "Installation-test System."

   Step 64:  Give the Command:  TERMINAL (MODE IS) NO RAISE.   Step 64:  Give the Command:  TERMINAL (MODE IS) NO RAISE.

   If you want lowercase letters in the system name,  type  TERMINAL  and
   press  the  ESC  key.  The system prints (MODE IS).  Type NO RAISE and
   press the RETURN key.   Make  sure  the  CAPS  LOCKED  button  on  the
   terminal is not depressed.  The system prints $.

                ESC

             type-system-name-here ^Z.             type-system-name-here ^Z.

   Type COPY and press the ESC key.  The system prints (FROM).  Type TTY:
   and  press  the ESC key.  The system prints (TO).  Type MONNAM.TXT and
   press the RETURN key.  The system is now waiting for you to  type  the
   new  name  of your system.  After you enter the new system name, press
   the RETURN key; then type a CTRL/Z.  The system prints ^Z, followed by
   the  $  prompt.  In the example below, we use Installation-test System
   as the new system name.

            ESC         ESC
             !           !
        $COPY (FROM) TTY: (TO) MONNAM.TXT<RET>
         TTY: => MONNAM.TXT.1

        Installation-test System  <RET>
        CTRL/Z
        !
        ^Z
        $

   You can change this file at any time, but the system reads the  system
   name only when the monitor is started (whenever you boot the system).


   Step 66:  Give the Command:  COPY (FROM)  TTY:   (TO)  TAPNAM.TXT<RET>   Step 66:  Give the Command:  COPY (FROM)  TTY:   (TO)  TAPNAM.TXT<RET>
             type-short-system-name-here ^Z.             type-short-system-name-here ^Z.

   You should also change the system name that will  be  written  on  the
   volume  header  label  of any tape initialized by users of the system.
   Do  this   by   entering   the   name   you   want   into   the   file
   PS:<SYSTEM>TAPNAM.TXT.   This  system  name  must contain ten or fewer
   characters, so you will probably have to abbreviate the name given  in
   the  previous step.  The following step shows how to change the system
   name appearing on tape labels written by the system to "Instal-tst".

            ESC         ESC
             !           !

        o  Scheduler controls

        o  File archiving and migration

        o  Tape drive allocation

        o  Accounting shift changes

   The next time the system starts,  the  SETSPD  (SET  System  Parameter
   Defaults)  program  uses  the parameters entered into this file.  This
   program runs automatically at system startup.

   The formats of the commands are described in  Sections  3.3.1  through
   3.3.13.   You  may  include  comment  lines  if  they  are preceded by
   exclamation points.

|  Reference  Manual  for more information on how to use EDIT.) To create
|  the file 6-CONFIG.CMD, type CREATE and press the ESC key.  The  system
|  prints  (FILE).   Type  6-CONFIG.CMD  and  press  the RETURN key.  The
|  system prints Input:  6-CONFIG.CMD.1 and line number 00100:

   Do not confuse the CREATE command, which  creates  a  file,  with  the
   CTRL/E CREATE command, which creates a directory.



   3.3.1  Setting Terminal Speeds   3.3.1  Setting Terminal Speeds

   Whenever the system starts, the  SETSPD  program  reads  the  TERMINAL
|  commands  from  PS:<SYSTEM>6-CONFIG.CMD and sets the terminal lines to
   the specified speeds.

   Users can change the speeds of their terminals by giving the  TERMINAL
   (MODE IS) SPEED command.  When one user logs out and another user logs
   in on the same terminal, the system does not  change  the  line  speed
|  back to the default listed in 6-CONFIG.CMD.

   However, if the line is defined as REMOTE, the speed is  changed  back
   after the line is disconnected.

   The operator can change the speed of the line by giving the CTRL/E SET
   command.

   To set the default speed for a particular line, enter a command in the
|  following format into 6-CONFIG.CMD:

        TERMINAL line SPEED input output

        line      An octal line number, or a range of lines in  the  form
                  line-line.   Your  DIGITAL Field Service Representative
                  will provide you with a list of line  numbers  and  the
                  corresponding locations.  (Refer to Section 1.2.)

        input     The input (to the system) speed of the terminal(s).

        output    The output speed of the terminal(s).   If  you  do  not
                  specify  an output speed along with an input speed, the
                  system assumes that the output speed is the same as the
                  input speed.

   Valid terminal speeds are:

                   0 (to shut off the line)      300
                  50                             600
                  75                            1200
                 110                            1800
                 134 (actually 134.5)           2400
                 150                            4800
                 200                            9600

                                    NOTE

           If you do not specify a speed for a line,  the  system
           uses 300 for both input and output.  If you have lines
           in the terminal controller (the  DH11)  that  are  not
           installed,  you should define those lines with a speed
           of  0.   Otherwise,  the  lines  run   open,   causing
           degradation in system performance.

   3.3.2  Defining Dial-Up (Remote) Lines   3.3.2  Defining Dial-Up (Remote) Lines

   For each dial-up line, you have the option of declaring that  line  to
   have a specified speed or you may declare a line to be autobaud.  If a
   dial-up line is declared an autobaud line, at system startup the  line
   can be automatically set to 9600 baud.

   To declare a line autobaud, replace the word SPEED with the word  AUTO
   in  the  TERMINAL  command  and  do  not  specify any input and output
   speeds.

   Include a TERMINAL command for each dial-up line.  Use the  same  form
   as  described above, but insert the word REMOTE after the line number.
   If you do not use the AUTO argument and omit  the  output  speed,  the
   system  assumes  that the output speed is the same as the input speed.
   The command format is:

        TERMINAL line REMOTE SPEED input output

   3.3.4  Defining Magnetic Tape Logical Unit Numbers   3.3.4  Defining Magnetic Tape Logical Unit Numbers

   The system assigns logical unit numbers to magnetic tape  drives.   It
   starts with the lowest numbered unit on the lowest numbered controller
   on the lowest numbered channel, and proceeds upward.  If  the  cabling
   connecting  the  tape  drives  to the system changes, the logical unit
   numbers referencing the tape drives can also change, unless you  enter
|  the   appropriate   commands   in   6-CONFIG.CMD.    The  commands  in
|  6-CONFIG.CMD guarantee that the physical drives always have  the  same
   logical unit numbers.

   Request the tape drive serial numbers from your DIGITAL Field  Service
   Representative,  or open the back door of the magnetic tape drives and
   look on the sticker containing the number.  Use the last  four  digits
   of  the  number.  Enter a MAGTAPE command in the following format into

   3.3.10.1  Bias Controls   3.3.10.1  Bias Controls - You have the option  of  deciding  how  your
   system's CPU time is to be divided between interactive and batch jobs.
|  You do this by entering the command, BIAS  n,  into  the  6-CONFIG.CMD
   file,  where n is any integer between 1 and 20.  The smaller the value
   of n, the  larger  the  percentage  of  CPU  time  that  is  given  to
   interactive jobs.  If you do not give this command, a default value of

   3.3.10.2  Class Scheduling   3.3.10.2  Class Scheduling - You can use class  scheduling  to  divide
   your  system's  CPU  time  among  different  classes  of  jobs.  Class
   scheduling assigns percentages of CPU time to jobs according to  their
   account number or according to a policy program written especially for
   your site.

                                    NOTE

           If you do not want to use class scheduling, you do not
|          have  to enter any command into the 6-CONFIG.CMD file,
           because    the    system    default    is:     DISABLE
           CLASS-SCHEDULING.

   If you use either kind of class scheduling you can allocate any unused
   CPU  time  (windfall) among active jobs, or withhold it from all jobs.
   The command for enabling class scheduling using a policy  program  and
   allocating   windfall   is:   ENABLE  CLASS-SCHEDULING  POLICY-PROGRAM
   ALLOCATED.  The command for enabling class scheduling using  a  policy
   program   and   withholding   windfall  is:   ENABLE  CLASS-SCHEDULING
   POLICY-PROGRAM WITHHELD.  If  you  enable  class  scheduling  using  a
   policy   program,  you  cannot  also  enable  class  scheduling  using
   accounts, and should skip to Section 3.3.11 after giving one of  these
   two commands.

   If you do not have a policy program to use with  class  scheduling  at
   your  site, you can still enable class scheduling by assigning jobs to
   classes according to the account under  which  each  job  is  running.
   (Refer  to  Chapter  6  of  the  TOPS-20  System  Manager's  Guide for
   information about associating accounts with particular  classes.)   To
|  do  this  you  must  first  enter commands into the 6-CONFIG.CMD file,
   specifying the percentage of CPU time that is to be given to  jobs  in
   each class.

   The command, CREATE 1 .20, specifies that jobs running under  accounts
   in  class  1 are to be given a total of 20% of your system's CPU time.
   You must enter a CREATE command for each class that your  system  will
                  _________   use,  with  a  different  percentage  for  each class.  The sum of the
   percentages you specify must not add up to more  than  100%,  although
   they  may add up to less than 100%.  If they add up to less than 100%,
   the percentage of CPU time that is not assigned becomes  part  of  the
   system's  windfall.  The following commands are an example of dividing
   up 75% of the system's CPU time among three classes of jobs.  You must
   supply the correct class numbers and percentages for your own system.


   Step 81:  Enter CREATE Commands for Scheduler Classes.   Step 81:  Enter CREATE Commands for Scheduler Classes.

|  Enter CREATE commands for your system's classes into 6-CONFIG.CMD.

|       04500   CREATE 3 .15<RET>
|       04600

   Batch jobs can be put into a special class of their own  by  including
   the  BATCH-CLASS  n  command,  where  n is the number of the class you
   choose for batch jobs.  If you do not  enter  a  BATCH-CLASS  command,
   batch  jobs  are given CPU time according to the class associated with
   the account of the  job's  owner  at  the  time  of  submission.   The
   following  commands  are an example of creating a class for batch jobs
   and assigning 25% of CPU time to this class.


   Step 82:  Enter the BATCH-CLASS n Command and Assign a  Percentage  to   Step 82:  Enter the BATCH-CLASS n Command and Assign a  Percentage  to
             This Class.             This Class.

|       04800   CREATE 4 .25<RET>
|       04900

   Now you must enter the command that  enables  class  scheduling  using
   accounts.   You  must also decide whether to allocate any windfall CPU
   time to the jobs that are running or to withhold this  windfall.   The
   default  for  this  command  is ALLOCATED.  It is recommended that you
   take this default.


   Step 83:  Type ENABLE CLASS-SCHEDULING ACCOUNTS  ALLOCATED  and  Press   Step 83:  Type ENABLE CLASS-SCHEDULING ACCOUNTS  ALLOCATED  and  Press
             the RETURN Key.             the RETURN Key.

   Now you actually enable  class  scheduling  by  giving  the  following
   command.

|       05000   ENABLE CLASS-SCHEDULING ACCOUNTS ALLOCATED<RET>
|       05100

                                  CAUTION

|          Do not enter the above command into  the  6-CONFIG.CMD
|          file until you have entered the commands shown in this
           section that create scheduler classes.  If you  enable
           class   scheduling   before  creating  classes,  class
           scheduling will not function properly.

   3.3.11.1  Archive Tape Recycle  Period   3.3.11.1  Archive Tape Recycle  Period - TOPS-20  provides  a  feature
   that  allows  off-line  storage of selected files on magnetic tape for
   long periods of time.  You can specify for how long  these  files  are
|  saved  by  inserting  a command into the 6-CONFIG.CMD file stating, in
   days, the recycle period of the tapes.  For example, to save  archival
   files   on   tape  for  five  years,  you  would  enter  the  command,
   ARCHIVE-TAPE-RECYCLE-PERIOD 1825 (because 5 years x  365  days/year  =
   1825  days).   If  you  do  not  insert an ARCHIVE-TAPE-RECYCLE-PERIOD
|  command in the 6-CONFIG.CMD file, a default value of 3650 (ten  years)
   will be taken.


   Step 84:  Type the ARCHIVE-TAPE-RECYCLE-PERIOD n Command.   Step 84:  Type the ARCHIVE-TAPE-RECYCLE-PERIOD n Command.

   3.3.11.2  Migration Tape Recycle Period   3.3.11.2  Migration Tape Recycle Period - TOPS-20 provides  a  feature
   that  allows automatic off-line storage of old or little-used files on
   magnetic tape for short periods of time.  You can specify for how long
|  these  files  are  saved  by inserting a command into the 6-CONFIG.CMD
   file stating, in days, the recycle period of the tapes.  For  example,
   to  save  migrated files on tape for three months, you would enter the
   command, TAPE-RECYCLE-PERIOD 90 (because 3 months x 30 days/month   = 
   90  days).   If you do not insert a TAPE-RECYCLE-PERIOD command in the
|  6-CONFIG.CMD file, a default value of 180 (six months) will be taken.

   To inform the system that you are creating a  structure,  type  CREATE
   and press the ESC key.  The system prints (NEW FILE SYSTEM FOR).  Type
   the name of the structure.  The structure name can consist of 1  to  6
   alphanumeric  characters.   The example uses FE-SYS.  Press the RETURN
   key.  The system prints ENTER ALIAS:.

   The front-end file system must reside on either an RP04 or  RP06  disk
   drive  that is connected to both the KL10 and PDP11 front-end.  If you
   are not sure, type a ?  and press the RETURN key.  The  system  prints
   the information needed to make the decision.  The example uses channel
   1, controller -1 (which is the default), and unit 0.  After  you  type
   this  information,  the  system prints NUMBER OF PAGES TO ALLOCATE FOR
   SWAPPING?

                     CREATING THE FRONT-END FILE SYSTEM                     CREATING THE FRONT-END FILE SYSTEM



   The steps in this chapter restore the front-end file system  when  you
   reinitialize  it  or change the front-end hardware.  They also restore
   the front-end software  if  the  front-end  file  system  on  disk  is
   destroyed.

   These steps copy the front-end software from the floppy disks  to  the
   front-end  file  space  on  the  public  structure.   They involve the
   following front-end programs:

        MOU  Adds a device to the list of front-end devices.

        UFD  Creates a directory in  the  front-end  file  space  on  the
             public structure.

        PIP  Copies files from the floppy disk to the public structure.

        RED  Changes the definition of the front-end  logical  name  SY0:
             from the floppy disk to the public structure.

        SAV  Saves the front-end monitor.

        INI  Initializes  the  front-end  file  system  on   the   public
             structure.

   4.3  COPYING FILES FROM FLOPPY DISK TO RP04 OR RP06   4.3  COPYING FILES FROM FLOPPY DISK TO RP04 OR RP06

   Use the following procedures to copy the files.  Remember that you are
   typing  commands  to the front end and that you must wait for a prompt
   before typing the answer.  There is no type-ahead feature except  when
   you  want  to type a CTRL/\.  You can type a CTRL/U to erase an entire
   line or  press  the  DELETE  key  to  erase  a  single  character  per
   keystroke.

   Many of the steps in this chapter and in Chapter  5  assume  that  the
   disk  pack is mounted on drive 0.  To use a dual-port drive other than
   drive 0, make the following changes:

        1.  Where a step calls for DB0:  to be typed, type the number  of
            the  actual  drive  used.   For  example:   DB1:,  DB2:, etc.
            Messages printed by the system will reflect this change.

        2.  If the disk is  mounted  on  a  drive  other  than  drive  0,
            pressing ENABLE and DISK in Step 151 will not work.  Instead,
            set the front-end switch register switches 7 and 0 in the  up
            position.   Set switches 10, 9, and 8 to the binary number of
            the drive used.  For example, for drive 1, set switch  8  up;
            for drive 2, set switch 9 up; for drive 3, set switches 9 and
            8 up.  After this has been completed, press  the  ENABLE  and
            SWITCH REGISTER buttons.


   Step 116:  Type CTRL/\.|  Step 116:  Type CTRL/\.

   To start the front-end Command Parser, type CTRL/\.  The system  takes
   about  10  seconds  to  load the Command Parser from the floppy disks.
   You are at Command Parser command level when  the  system  prints  the
   prompt  PAR%.  The % after PAR indicates that the central processor is
   not running:

   Step 117:  STOP.|  Step 117:  STOP.

   The central processor (as opposed to the front-end processor) must  be
   halted  before you proceed to the next step.  If the central processor
   is not halted,  the  front-end  monitor  will  not  be  saved  in  the
   front-end  file  system in a usable state.  When the central processor
   is stopped, the system prints a percent sign, %, following the Command
   Parser  prompt.   If  it prints an angle bracket, >, give the SHUTDOWN

                           RESTARTING THE SYSTEM                           RESTARTING THE SYSTEM



   At this point you have:

        1.  Initialized the TOPS-20 file system.

        2.  Loaded  the  TOPS-20  monitor  and  related   programs   into
            directories PS:<SYSTEM> and PS:<SUBSYS>.

        3.  Loaded the files for  the  TOPS-20  User  Environmental  Test
            Package into directory PS:<UETP.LIB>.

        4.  Created the system initialization files.

        5.  Loaded the front-end software into the TOPS-20 file system.

|  The only thing left to be done is to restart the system.  Once this is
   done,  the  TOPS-20  file  system  is  intact and the standard TOPS-20
   bundled software is completely installed on your system.   This  means
   you can stop the system and reboot it from the file system on disk.

   Whenever you have to restart the system,  be  sure  that  the  central
   processor  is  stopped;  otherwise  you can damage the file system you
   just created.


   Step 149:  Be Sure that the Central Processor Is Stopped|  Step 149:  Be Sure that the Central Processor Is Stopped

   Check your output to be sure that the last time the system printed the
   prompt  PAR  (in Step 149) it was followed by a % to indicate that the
   central processor has stopped.  If the prompt is followed by a >, type
   SHUTDOWN and press the RETURN key.


   Step 150:  Hold ENABLE and Press the DISK Button.|  Step 150:  Hold ENABLE and Press the DISK Button.

   To restart the system, hold ENABLE and press  the  DISK  button.   The
   system  restarts after a few seconds and obtains all the software from
   the TOPS-20 file system.

   If the TOPS-20 file system is on a drive other than drive  0,  holding
   the  ENABLE  button  and  pressing the DISK button does not work.  You
   must set the switch register  to  the  appropriate  disk  drive.   For
   example,  if the TOPS-20 file system is on drive 1, set switches 8, 7,
   and 0 up; for drive 2, set switches 9, 7 and 0 up.  (Refer to Part  4,

   Once you have set the switches to the  appropriate  disk  drive,  hold
   ENABLE  and  press  the  SWITCH  REGISTER  button rather than the DISK
   button.  When  you  follow  this  procedure,  the  system  prints  the

             the disk pack on the dual-port drive does  not  contain  the
             front-end  software.   Perhaps  the wrong disk pack has been
             mounted.  But if everything appears to be in order, try  the

   Step 154:  Type N and Press the RETURN Key.|  Step 154:  Type N and Press the RETURN Key.

   The CHECKD program examines the entire disk file system, reports any
   errors,  and  tries  to  correct  them.  You do not have to run this
   program unless the system crashes  unexpectedly,  or  if,  for  some
   other  reason,  you  suspect  that there may be disk errors.  If you
   halt the system by giving a CTRL/E CEASE command or  by  using  some
   other  controlled  means,  you  do  not  have  to  run CHECKD before
   restarting.

   Type N and press the RETURN key.  The system prints RUNNING DDMP and
   runs the SYSJOB.RUN file.

   If you do run CHECKD, be prepared for a long wait until  the  system
   prints  something on your console terminal.  For each inconsistency,
   CHECKD prints a  message  and  the  directory  in  which  the  error
   occurred.   (Refer  to  the  TOPS-20  Operator's Guide for a list of
   CHECKD error messages.)

              INSTALLING TOPS-20 DISTRIBUTION AND UPDATE TAPES              INSTALLING TOPS-20 DISTRIBUTION AND UPDATE TAPES



   The steps  in  this  section  describe  how  to  install  the  TOPS-20
   distribution tape or any TOPS-20 update tapes.

   To install any option software products, follow the steps specified in
   the   installation  guide  that  accompanies  each  optional  software
   product.

   The TOPS-20 distribution tape contains four savesets.  These  savesets
   are:   documentation  regarding  specific programs; sources that allow
   you to rebuild certain programs, if required;  language  sources  that
   allow  you  to  rebuild certain language modules, such as MACRO, LINK;
   GALAXY sources that allow you to rebuild a GALAXY system, if required.

   If you are installing the TOPS-20 DECnet-20 software on a 2060, follow
   the steps in the TOPS-20 DECnet-20 Manual.

   If you are installing the  IBM  communications  software,  follow  the
   steps in the IBM Emulation/Termination Manual.

   This chapter describes how to run the User Environment  Test  Package.
   This program performs a cursory check of the system.

   This program starts a number of tests that  can  run  either  once  or
   repeatedly.   The  source  files are kept in the directory <UETP.LIB>,
   while the temporary data files and results of the test are  stored  in
   the  directory <UETP.RUN>.  For more information on UETP, refer to the
   User Environment Test Package Reference Manual.

                                    NOTE

           If you performed  the  steps  in  Chapter  6  of  this
|          manual,  you  may skip Steps 177 through 179 and start
|          at Step 180.  You should perform all the steps in this
           chapter  on  the  operator's  console  terminal (CTY).
           Otherwise, you must return to the CTY after completing
           the  steps  in  this  chapter to resume control of the

   From the above example  you  can  see  that  the  RANCBL.SUP  test  is
   running,  the  RANFOR.SUP  and MTA0.SUP tests are in a wait state, and
   the VERIFY.SUP test has ended.

   If under the heading ERROR COUNT there is a number other  than  0,  be
   sure  to  print  the ERRORS.LOG file, when the tests are completed, to
   find out what caused the error.

   The UETP program does not notify you when all the tests are completed.
   To  find  out when all the tests are completed, give a STATUS command.
   When all the tests are completed, your output from the STATUS  command
   resembles the following:

|  This appendix describes how to  install  Version  6.0  software  on  a
|  DECSYSTEM-20 now running TOPS-20 Version 5.1 software.

   As you update the system, enter the  commands  printed  in  red.   The
   system's replies are printed in black.

   The updating procedures are divided into four sections.  They are:
|  
|        o  INSTALLING THE VERSION 6.0 SOFTWARE (Section A.1)
|  
|        o  REVERTING TO VERSION 5.1 (Section A.2)
|  
|        o  MAKING THE VERSION 6.0 MONITOR THE PRIMARY  MONITOR  (Section
|           A.3)
|  
|        o  MAKING THE VERSION 6.0 MONITOR THE PERMANENT MONITOR (Section
|           A.4)

   The steps in this Appendix assume you are using the CTY.

         o  System Floppy A

         o  System Floppy B
|  
|        o  System Floppy C, which should be used for  new  installations
            ____|           only.   If  you  are  updating  your software from a previous
                     __ ___ ___|           version, DO NOT USE Floppy C.
|  
|        o  TOPS-20 Installation Tape V6.0

         o  RP20 Microcode Tape (RP20 only)

         o  A separate tape for each optional software product  you  have

|          compare  these  files  if  you  have  not  changed the
|          Version 5.1 file.  However, if you have made your  own
           changes  to  the  Version  5.1 PTYCON.ATO file and you
|          wish those changes to exist  under  Version  6.0,  you

              GENERATING A TAILORED BATCH AND SPOOLING SYSTEM              GENERATING A TAILORED BATCH AND SPOOLING SYSTEM



   C.1  INTRODUCTION   C.1  INTRODUCTION

   This appendix shows you how to generate a TOPS-20 batch  and  spooling
   (GALAXY)  system  specifically  tailored for your installation.  To do
|  this you must have already  installed  a  standard  Release  5  GALAXY
|  system.   The  standard  GALAXY system is satisfactory for most sites.
   The procedures shown in Chapters 1 through 7 of  this  manual,  or  in
|  Appendix A or B, show you how to install Release 6.0 TOPS-20 software,
|  including a standard Release 5 GALAXY system.  After performing  those
   procedures,  you  can  use  the  steps in this appendix if you need to
   generate a GALAXY system having different parameters from the standard
   one.

                                    NOTE

|          While the steps in generating  a  tailored  Release  5
|          GALAXY  system  can  be  used  with  timesharing users
|          logged in, the critical phase of stopping the standard
|          Release  5  system  and  starting up your tailored one
|          (Steps 29-56) should, for safety reasons, be performed
           on  a  stand-alone  system.   The  queues  need not be
|          empty, however, as long as a Release 5 (as opposed  to
|          Release  4.2  or  earlier)  GALAXY  system  is already
           running.

   The following paragraphs summarize the procedure  for  generating  and
   starting  up  a new GALAXY system.  The actual steps you would perform
   are shown in the next section.

        1.  Run the DUMPER program to transfer the  GALAXY  source  files
            from  the  TOPS-20  bundled system software tape (also called
            the TOPS-20 Distribution Tape) to  a  disk  directory.   This
            directory  is  referred to as the build area.  In addition to
            the source code, this  directory  contains  a  special  batch
            control file called GALAXY.CTL.

        2.  Run the GALGEN program to create a file  containing  the  new
            GALAXY  system parameters.  The name of the parameter file is
            GALCNF.MAC.

        3.  Submit the control file GALAXY.CTL to your currently  running
            batch  system.   The  batch job that is created by GALAXY.CTL
            reads the parameter file created by GALGEN  and  generates  a
            new  set  of  GALAXY  files of type .EXE in a temporary area.
            The batch job creates a log file that  should  be  saved  for
            reference,  at least until the new GALAXY system is correctly
            operating.

        4.  Stop all the  components  of  the  currently  running  GALAXY
            system (QUASAR, LPTSPL, etc.).

        5.  Copy all old GALAXY files from their  current  area  (usually
            SYS:) to some other area.

        6.  Copy all new GALAXY files from the temporary area to SYS:.

        7.  Start up the components of the new batch system.

        8.  When you are sure that the  new  batch  system  is  operating
            correctly,  you  can delete the .EXE files of the old system.
            If you want to be cautious, you can save the old  .EXE  files
            on  tape.   You  can also delete the GALAXY source files (and
            the  unrelated  files  restored  along  with  them  from  the
            Distribution  Tape)  from  the  build area.  However, if your
            installation can spare the disk space, it is more  convenient
            to leave the sources on disk.  Then, if any code patches must
            be made to the batch system, you  have  the  sources  readily
            available.   Otherwise,  you have to restore the sources from
            the software tape if patching is required.

                                        NOTE

                    The procedures described  below  assume  that
|                   you  have a Release 5 GALAXY system currently
                    running.  These procedures can be carried out
                    during normal timesharing.

            Press the RETURN Key.            Press the RETURN Key.

   To allow the use of a tape  drive  without  the  intervention  of  the
   MOUNTR program, give the command SET TAPE-DRIVE, and insert the number
   of a tape drive that is not  presently  in  use  (MTA0:   is  only  an
   example).   Type  UNAVAILABLE  and  press  the RETURN key.  The system
   prints, Enter Text and Terminate with ^Z.

                   ______________ ________ ___ __________                   Administrative Controls and Parameters

   The questions in this section determine  absolute  GALAXY  parameters,
   which cannot be overridden by user or operator controls.

   The system logs all operator  interactions  in  a  disk  file  in  the
   spooling  area.   Your  answer to the following question specifies the
   name to be used for this file.

   Operator log filename(3-20 Characters) [OPERATOR-SYSTEM]

   Users can specify a priority for their  batch  and  spooling  requests
   with  the  /PRIORITY  switch.   The allowable values on this parameter
   range between 1 (representing lowest priority)  and  63  (representing
   the highest).  The following two questions relate to this switch.  The
   first question requests the maximum priority that may be specified  by
   a non-privileged user.

   Maximum priority non-privileged users may specify(10-63) [20]

   You can specify the value to be used if the user does  not  specify  a
   /PRIORITY  switch.   This value must be between 1 and the maximum that
   you specified in the previous question.

   Default for /PRIORITY on batch and spooling requests(1-63) [10]

|  This value is to  control  the  number  of  objects  (printers,  batch
|  streams,  etc.)  that  can  be  controlled by a single command in OPR.
|  This value should be at least the  maximum  number  of  objects  of  a
|  single type you may have.  The value must be at least 1.
|  
|  Maximum number of objects that  can  be  contolled  with  one  command
|  (1-100) [6]
|  
|  Specify the highest number that a batch stream can be on  the  system.
|  The value must be greater than zero and less than or equal to 10000.

   The questions in this section are used to define  default  values  for
   the  various  options  that a user can specify when submitting a batch
   job.

   The batch user can specify a maximum runtime for his batch  job  using
   the  /TIME  switch.  If he does not specify this switch, the following
   default will be used:

   Default batch job runtime limit (5-9999 Seconds) [300]<RET>

   Every batch job has maximum limits for each type  of  spooled  output.
   These limits can be set by the batch user with appropriate switches to
   the SUBMIT command.  If the user doesn't specify these  switches,  the
   following defaults will be used:

   Line printer output limit(0-9999 pages) [200]
   Card punch output limit(0-9999 cards) [1000]
   Paper tape punch output limit(0-5000 feet) [200]
   Plotter output limit(0-5000 minutes) [30]

   The user can specify whether or not  the  batch  log  file  should  be
   printed  after  the  job terminates by using the /OUTPUT switch to the
   SUBMIT command.  The action is specified by:  LOG to always print  the
   log  file,  NOLOG  to never print the log file, and ERROR to print the
   log file only if the job ended with an unhandled error.  If  the  user
   doesn't specify this switch, the following value will be used:

   Job banner pages printed at the beginning of each print request.   The
   user's name and any /NOTE value is printed on them.

   Number of job banner pages (0-5) [2]

   Job trailer pages are printed at the end of each print  request.   The
   user's name and any spooler checkpoint information is printed on them.

   Number of job trailer pages(0-5) [2]

   File header pages are printed before each file or copy in  each  print
   request.   The  file  name  is  printed in BOLD letters on each header
   page.

   Number of file header pages(0-5) [2]

   The user can specify a special form  for  a  print  request  with  the
   /FORMS switch.  If this switch is not specified, the following default
   will be used:

   Name for standard output forms (of 4-6 characters) [NORMAL]

   The number of characters that uniquely identifies a form  is  compared
   with  the current form name to determine if a forms change is required
   for a specific user request.

   In the last step you completed the GALGEN program, which produced  the
   GALAXY  parameter file, GALCNF.MAC.  This file contains your choice of
   options for a tailored batch and  spooling  system.   To  create  this
   batch  and  spooling  system  you must submit the GALAXY control file,
   GALAXY.CTL, to your present batch system.  GALAXY.CTL reads GALCNF.MAC
   and generates the files and programs for a tailored GALAXY system.

   Type SUBMIT and press the ESC key;  the  system  prints  (BATCH  JOB).
   Type  GALAXY  and  press  the ESC key; the system prints .CTL.1.  Type

           If assembly is unsuccessful, examine  the  appropriate
           .LOG  file to see if you can find the problem.  If you
           can, correct  it  (which  might  involve  editing  the
           control  file), delete the .LOG file, and resubmit the
           specified .CTL file.  If you are unable  to  determine
           what   caused   the   failure,  consult  your  systems
           programmer or software specialist.

   When the GALAXY system assembly succeeds, you see a series of messages
   similar to the following printed on your terminal:

        LPTSPL ASSEMBLY SUCCESSFUL

        CDRIVE ASSEMBLY SUCCESSFUL
                               .

                               .

   A message is printed for each control file generated.

   The new batch system can now be run.  However, before you  proceed  to
   the next step, it is advisable to check the .LOG files to be sure that
   no problems arose during batch system generation.  It  is  conceivable
   that a %-type (warning) error occurred.  Such an error might not cause
   processing of GALAXY.CTL to be unsuccessful, but could create problems
   later  when you attempt to use the new batch system.  Therefore, it is
   important that you correct any problems now, before you  stop  running
   the current batch system.
