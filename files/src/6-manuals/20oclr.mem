   _______ __________ _____   TOPS-20 Operator's Guide.

   You also use the OPR command language to communicate with any  program
   requesting  operator  action  (such as the PLEASE program) or with any
   user on the system.

   The component that receives the OPR commands and communicates with all
   the other operating system components is ORION.



   1.2  RUNNING OPR AND EXITING FROM IT   1.2  RUNNING OPR AND EXITING FROM IT

   To start OPR, you must have WHEEL or OPERATOR privileges.   (See  your
   System  Manager  to  get  these  privileges if you do not already have

   either of them.)

   To handle all batch software tasks and all PLEASE, MOUNT, and DISMOUNT
   requests,  you  must  have  OPR  running.   Normally,  commands in the
   PTYCON.ATO file start  OPR  automatically  as  a  PTYCON  subjob.   An
   example of this command file is shown below.

        SILENCE
        LOG
        DEFINE ^$OPR
        CONNECT OPR
        LOG OPERATOR FOO OPERATOR

        ^ESET LOGIN ANY
                S        ^ESEND  SYSTEM IN OPERATION
        POP

   The command TAKE SYS:SYSTEM.CMD in the above  PTYCON.ATO  example  can
   contain  any  number  of  OPR  commands  to  set and start devices and
   streams automatically.  An example of a  SYSTEM.CMD  command  file  is
   shown below.

   __________ _____   Operator's Guide Part V and in Chapter 2 of this manual.

                                    NOTE

           It is the responsibility of  your  System  Manager  to
           determine whether OPR is to run as a subjob of PTYCON.
           In addition,  your  System  Manager  should  determine
           whether any other program or utility should be started
           as a PTYCON subjob.

   To start OPR yourself under a job with OPERATOR  privileges,  all  you
   need to do is to type ENABLE and then type OPR.

   OPR is your primary  interface  with  the  operating  system  and  its
   devices.   Thus,  it  is  recommended  that if your installation has a
   hardcopy central terminal (CTY), it should be dedicated to OPR.  To do
   this,  LOGIN and ATTACH to PTYCON; the OPR> prompt then appears at the
   CTY.  In the following example, your password is FOO and your  account
   number is OPERATOR.

   If your installation has  more  than  one  terminal  assigned  to  its
   operators,  you  can run separate OPRs from different terminals.  (See
   Section 1.2.2.) Thus, OPR can run as a  subjob  under  PTYCON  at  one
   terminal  and  as  a job by itself at another terminal.  All OPRs have
   the same functionality as the OPR running as a subjob  of  PTYCON  and
   CONNECTed  to  the  CTY.   ORION,  the  OPR-controlling component, can
   handle an unlimited number of terminals running  OPR.   Multiple  OPRs
   are discussed in Section 1.2.2.

   If you want OPR as a subjob under PTYCON and the PTYCON.ATO  file  did
   not  automatically  start  OPR,  you can either CONNECT to a subjob to
   start OPR or DEFINE a subjob as OPR  and  then  CONNECT  to  it.   The
   examples below show both methods of creating an OPR subjob.

   When you issue a command to OPR,  OPR  validates  the  syntax  of  the
   command  and  generates error messages for any errors it may find.  If
   there are no errors, the command is passed to the correct  process  to
   be executed.

   If you receive an  error  message,  you  can  retype  the  entire  OPR
   command,  or  press  <CTRL/H>  to  reprint the command up to the point
   where the error occurred in the command.  (Refer to Section 1.4.2.)

   To exit from OPR at any time, simply  issue  the  command  EXIT.   You
   immediately  return  to  TOPS-20 command level and you are prompted by
   the dollar-sign ($).  For example:

        OPR>EXIT<RET>
        $

   If OPR is a subjob of PTYCON, you  can  type  <CTRL/X>  to  return  to
   PTYCON command level.  For example:

        OPR>^X
             !
          <CTRL/X>
        PTYCON>

   In addition, you can give the PUSH command to OPR to return to TOPS-20
   command  processor  level.   Then, you can execute any program or task
   and then give the POP command to return to OPR.  However,  you  cannot
   LOGOUT while PUSHed to OPR.

   1.2.1  Issuing OPR Commands to and from Remote Stations   1.2.1  Issuing OPR Commands to and from Remote Stations

   In a data networking environment, a DECSYSTEM-20 communicates with one
   or  more separate computer processors.  Each processor in a network is
   called a "node." The DECSYSTEM-20, running TOPS-20, is a "host"  node.
   The host node is the only type of node in the TOPS-20 network that can
   support interactive users on a timesharing basis.  The operator at the
   host  node  is  the system operator.  The system operator controls the
   devices connected to his host node and those connected to  the  remote
   stations that are controlled by his host node.

   In a DECnet network, two or more  hosts  may  communicate.   The  host
   operator  logs  into  his  "local"  host.   The other hosts are called
   "remote" hosts.  The host operator cannot control  devices  at  remote
   hosts.

   The processors in the TOPS-20 network,  other  than  host  nodes,  are
   known  as  remote  stations.   These  remote  stations  do not support
   interactive users, and usually have  one  card  reader  and  one  line
   printer.  Remote stations are used for remote submission of batch jobs
   to a host node.   The  operator  at  a  remote  station  is  a  remote
   operator.    The  remote  operator  can  control  only  those  devices
   connected to his remote station.  He cannot  control  devices  at  the
   host node.

   The remote station is one of two types:  A DECnet node or an  IBM-type
   node.    Your   remote   station   operators  should  have  additional
   documentation.  The following manuals are available for remote station
   operators:

            ___  _____________________         o  IBM  Emulation/Termination  is  useful  for  IBM-type  remote
            stations.

            ___ _____ ______ _______ _____         o  The DN200 Remote Station Guide is useful for DECnet-20 remote
            stations.

   These manuals will help the remote station  operator  determine  those
   functions he can perform at the remote station.  The commands that the
   remote station operator uses will  work  on  his  remote  station;  no

   further specification is necessary.

|  The system operator can perform any of the functions in  this  manual.
   However, no operator can control devices at a remote host node.

   The OPR program allows the operator to specify a remote  node  as  the
   destination  for  a  command.   Many  OPR commands recognize the /NODE
   switch.  The /NODE switch can specify  either  a  DECnet  or  IBM-type
   remote  station, or it can specify the operator's host node; it cannot
|  be used to specify a remote  DECnet  host  node.   To  use  the  /NODE
   switch, type the following in the command line:

|       /NODE:node-name::

|  Two colons (::) following the node name are optional.



   1.2.2  Multiple OPRs on the System   1.2.2  Multiple OPRs on the System

   You can have more than one OPR running on the same  operating  system.
   ORION   keeps   track   of   each   OPR   and  sends  the  appropriate
   acknowledgement messages to the OPR that sent the command.

   Only  the  host  system  can  have   more   than   one   OPR   running
   simultaneously.  Remote stations can only have one OPR running.  Thus,
   if you have remote stations at your  installation,  any  message  sent
   from a remote station to the host system displays at all OPR's running
   at the host.  If a message is sent to a remote station from  the  host
   (the /NODE:  switch), the message displays only at that node.

   Each OPR that is processing can be set to enable or disable the  types
   of messages to be displayed at that OPR console.  For example, one OPR
   could be responsible for only tape and disk mounts and dismounts,  and
   another  OPR  could  be  responsible  for  everything  else.  Refer to
   Section 1.4.1 for descriptions of the DISABLE and ENABLE commands.



   1.3  OPR COMMAND FEATURES   1.3  OPR COMMAND FEATURES

   The OPR command language has three command features that allow you  to
   do the following:

        1.  List available commands - ?

        2.  Use recognition - <ESC>

        3.  Reprint faulty commands - <CTRL/H>

   These features are described in detail in the  following  sections  of
   this chapter.


                                    1-6
                        THE OPERATOR INTERFACE, OPR                        THE OPERATOR INTERFACE, OPR


   If you are a remote station operator (that is,  if  your  installation
   has  DECnet software), you will not have the above features.  However,
   you can obtain help with the HELP command at OPR command level.  Refer
   to Chapter 2 Section 2.13 for a description of the HELP command.

   In  addition,  CTRL/character  commands  such  as  CTRL/R  and  CTRL/U
   function at OPR command level as they do at TOPS-20 command level.



   1.3.1  ?  (Question Mark) - Listing Available Commands   1.3.1  ?  (Question Mark) - Listing Available Commands

   You can type a question mark at command level or while in the  process
   of typing a command.

   When you type a question  mark  to  the  OPR>  prompt,  it  lists  the
   available  OPR commands.  When you type a question mark in the process
   of entering an OPR command, it lists the available  keywords  to  that
   command.   When  you type a question mark after the keyword, OPR lists
   the available values, arguments, and/or switches to that keyword.   If
   you type a question mark after an entire OPR command, OPR replies with
   the message:  "confirm with  carriage  return",  retypes  your  entire
   command, and waits for you to press the carriage return key.

                          ----- Restriction -----

   If you type a question mark after an OPR command  argument  or  switch
   and  there  are  no  additional  arguments  that  can be supplied, OPR
   responds with the message:  "confirm with carriage  return"  and  then
   retypes  your  complete  OPR  command  and  waits for you to press the
   carriage return key.  (All OPR  commands  must  end  with  a  carriage
   return;  the  ESCape,  <CTRL/H>,  and  ?   features do not require the
   carriage return.)

                            ----- Examples -----

        1.  Start OPR and, after the system prompts you with OPR>, type a
            question mark.

                    The NCP command appears in the above  example
                    when  your  installation  has DECnet software
                    and  your  system  has  been  generated   for
                    network  communication.  Refer to the TOPS-20
                    DECnet Reference Manual for a description  of
                    NCP commands.

        2.  Type a question mark after typing  a  letter.   OPR  responds
            with the commands that begin with that letter.

            OPR>A? one of the following:
             ABORT     ALIGN
            OPR>A

        3.  Type a question mark after typing the ABORT  command  to  the
            OPR>  prompt;  OPR then lists the available arguments for the
            ABORT command, retypes your command, and waits for one of the
            arguments.

            OPR>ABORT ?

        4.  Type the same  ABORT  command  as  above  with  the  argument
            PRINTER and then type a question mark.  OPR replies with Unit
            Number (/NODE:).

            OPR>ABORT PRINTER ? Unit Number (/NODE:)
            OPR>ABORT PRINTER

            Supply the unit number (0) and  then  type  another  question

   1.3.2  ESCape - Using Recognition   1.3.2  ESCape - Using Recognition

   The ESCape feature allows recognition input and guide words to  appear
   on your console when you give an OPR command.

   To give the ESCape feature, you must press the key labeled  ESC,  SEL,
   PRE, or ALT depending on the type of terminal at your installation.

                                    NOTE

           All OPR commands accept  recognition  input  when  you
           press  the  ESCape  key, and most OPR commands provide
           guide words within parentheses.   However,  only  this
           section of the manual describes this ESCape feature of
           the OPR command language.

           ESCape is not available at remote  station  terminals.
           If you are at a remote station, use the HELP command.

   To use the ESCape key for recognition, type  the  first  one  or  more
   letters  of  an  OPR  command  to  make  it  unique from all other OPR
   commands, such as REQ (for the REQUEUE command), and press the  ESCape
   key.   OPR  responds  with  the  remainder of the command REQUEUE, the
   guide words within parentheses (Current Job  on),  and  waits  for  an
   argument for the REQUEUE command.

            <ESC>
              !
        OPR>REQUEUE (Current Job on) 

   Now type the first one or more letters of a REQUEUE argument, such  as
   PR  (for  PRINTER)  and  press  the ESCape key.  OPR responds with the
   remainder of the keyword PRINTER, the guide words  within  parenthesis

   1.3.3  <CTRL/H> - Reprinting Faulty Commands   1.3.3  <CTRL/H> - Reprinting Faulty Commands

   The <CTRL/H> feature prints the command you issued that resulted in an
   OPR  error  message.   An OPR error message occurs when a command does


                                    1-10

   not have the correct format, syntax, switch, or value.

   When you press <CTRL/H>  after  the  error  message  appears  on  your
   terminal,  OPR retypes your entire command up to the point you entered
   the incorrect command input.

   To use the <CTRL/H> feature, type an OPR command such as SET with  the
   argument BATCH-STREAM but misspell the word STREAM.

        OPR>SET BATCH-STRAEM 0 NOOPR-INTERVENTION<RET>
        ? Does not match switch or keyword:"BATCH-STRAEM"
        OPR>SET
            !
        <CTRL/H>

   Now retype the keyword BATCH-STREAM correctly, but type an  O  instead
   of a 0 (zero) for the same command.

        OPR>SET BATCH-STREAM O NOOPER-INTERVENTION<RET>
|       ? First nonspace character is not a digit:
        OPR>SET BATCH-STREAM 
             
               

   Now retype the correct stream number of 0 and misspell  the  parameter
   NOOPR-INTERVENTION.  After the error message appears, you complete the
   command correctly.

        OPR>SET BATCH-STREAM 0 NOPR-INTERVENTION<RET>
        ? Does not match switch or keyword
        OPR>SET BATCH-STREAM 0 NOOPR-INTERVENTION<RET>

   1.3.4  Continuing OPR Command Lines   1.3.4  Continuing OPR Command Lines

   While you are using the OPR program, you may find it necessary to type
   a  command line that is longer than the maximum line length allowed by
   your terminal.  You may continue typing the command past  the  end  of
   the  line  and  onto the next line, without pressing RETURN.  OPR will
   accept arguments which are divided between lines.   Note  the  divided
   word, DISPOSITION, in this example:

        OPR>SET TAPE-DRIVE MTA3: INITIALIZE/LABEL-TYPE:ANSI/TAPE-DIS
        POSITION:HOLD/VOLUME-ID:FOOBAR<RET>

   If you want to avoid divided  words,  you  may  use  the  continuation
   feature.   At  the  end of the first line, type a space, then a hyphen
   (-), and press RETURN.  Then finish the command on the next line.

        OPR>SET TAPE-DRIVE MTA3: INITIALIZE/LABEL-TYPE:ANSI -<RET>
        /TAPE-DISPOSITION:HOLD/VOLUME-ID:FOOBAR<RET>

   Note that the OPR> prompt does not appear on the  second  line,  after
   you  press  RETURN the first time.  The space and hyphen indicate that
   you wish to continue typing on the next line.



   1.4  OPR MESSAGES   1.4  OPR MESSAGES

   There are two types of messages that can appear at your OPR terminal:





                                    1-12
                        THE OPERATOR INTERFACE, OPR                        THE OPERATOR INTERFACE, OPR


        1.  ORION-to-OPR messages (Section 1.4.1)

        2.  OPR error messages (Section 1.4.2)




   1.4.1  ORION-To-OPR Messages   1.4.1  ORION-To-OPR Messages

   The types of messages from ORION to OPR that can appear  at  your  OPR
   terminal are messages about:

        1.  Errors generated when ORION accepts an OPR command, but  does
            not have the appropriate devices, streams, nodes, or jobs

        2.  Jobs that start processing within a stream or device

        3.  Jobs that end processing within a stream or device

        4.  Actions that you must perform for various  devices,  streams,
            or jobs

        5.  Information you must respond to

        6.  Results from TAKE command files

   Each OPR command that is sent to ORION is time stamped by  ORION  when
   the command is accepted and executed.  The acceptance and execution of
   the command is then returned to the OPR terminal  in  the  form  of  a
   message  with  the  time  stamp  as  the first eight characters of the
   message.  For example, the OPR command:

        OPR>SET PRINTER 0 FORMS-TYPE NARROW<RET>

   returns to your terminal an ORION message in the format:

        hh:mm:ss        Printer 0  --Set Accepted--

   where hh is the hour, mm is the minutes, and ss is  the  seconds  that
   the command was accepted and executed.

   Likewise, when ORION accepts an  OPR  command  but  returns  an  error
   message,  that  message  also contains a time stamp.  For example, the
   OPR command:

        OPR>SHOW MESSAGES<RET>

   displays  the  following  information  message  when  there   are   no
   outstanding messages to respond to:

        hh:mm:ss        --No Outstanding Messages--

                        THE OPERATOR INTERFACE, OPR                        THE OPERATOR INTERFACE, OPR


   When a particular job starts to process within a batch stream or on  a
   device,  ORION  displays  a message at your OPR terminal to notify you
   that the stream or device is active.  For example:

        hh:mm:ss        Batch-stream 0  --Begin--
                        Job TEST Req #274 for ZINA

        OPR>

   appears on your terminal when a job named TEST begins  to  process  in
   batch  stream  0 for user ZINA.  The hh:mm:ss at the beginning of this
   message is the time that the job started to process  (hours,  minutes,
   seconds).

   Likewise, when a particular job ends its  processing  within  a  batch
   stream  or  on a device, ORION displays a message at your OPR terminal
   to notify you that the stream or device is not active and the job  has
   completed.  For example:

        hh:mm:ss        Batch-stream 0  --End--
                        Job TEST Req #274 for ZINA
        OPR>

   appears on your terminal when a job named TEST  ends  the  process  in
   batch  stream  0 for user ZINA.  The hh:mm:ss at the beginning of this
   message is the time that the job ended the  process  (hours,  minutes,
   seconds).



   1.4.2  OPR Error Messages   1.4.2  OPR Error Messages

   In the course of using  OPR  to  enter  commands,  you  will  probably
   encounter  some  error  messages.  All OPR error messages begin with a
   question mark.  Error messages can  not  be  abbreviated  with  system
   switches  or  parameters as in some system programs.  In addition, the
   question mark does not represent a fatal error in OPR as  it  does  in
   some other system programs.

   When you receive an error message, you can  press  CTRL/H  (to  retype
   your  OPR  command  up  to  the  point where you entered the incorrect
   keyword, switch, or value) and then specify the correct input  to  the
   command.   As  with  all  OPR commands, if you do not know the command
   format or you have forgotten the keywords, switches, or values, type a
   question  mark  and  OPR  lists  the  command  arguments  that you can
   specify.

   Each error message described below and on the following pages explains
   the error message and a possible solution.


                  ?  Ambiguous:   ERROR:         ?  Ambiguous:

|  Reason:        You abbreviated a keyword  or  switch  but  it  is  not
|                 unique;  one  or  more  other keywords or switches also
|                 have the same abbreviation.
|  
|  Recovery:      Press CTRL/H or retype the command and  include  enough
|                 letters   of   the   keyword  or  switch  to  make  the
|                 abbreviation unique.


                  ?  Does not match switch or keyword:  "argument"|  ERROR:         ?  Does not match switch or keyword:  "argument"

   Reason:        You have specified a  switch  or  keyword  for  an  OPR
                  command  that  does  not  take  the  switch  or keyword
|                 specified.  The invalid switch or keyword is  displayed
|                 in quotes.

   Recovery:      Type the command again and specify the  correct  switch
                  or keyword.


                  ?  File not found "file"|  ERROR:         ?  File not found "file"

   Reason:        You have specified an OPR command  that  takes  a  file
                  specification  as  a  keyword  or switch value, but the
                  file was not found.

   Recovery:      Press CTRL/H or retype  the  command  and  specify  the
                  correct file specification.


                  ?   First  nonspace   character   is   not   a   digit:   ERROR:         ?   First  nonspace   character   is   not   a   digit:
                  "character"                  "character"

   Reason:        You have specified a keyword or switch value that  must
                  be numeric, but the first character is an alphabetic or
                  is a special character.

   Recovery:      Press CTRL/H  or  retype  the  command  and  specify  a
                  numeric  keyword  or  switch  value with any alphabetic
                  character.


                  ?  Invalid character in number   ERROR:         ?  Invalid character in number

   Reason:        You have specified a numeric value to  an  argument  or
                  switch  that  is  less than or greater than the allowed
                  value range.

   Recovery:      Press CTRL/H  or  retype  the  command  and  specify  a
                  numeric  value  that  is  within the allowable range of
                  values.

                  ?  Invalid device terminator:  "device name"|  ERROR:         ?  Invalid device terminator:  "device name"

   Reason:        You have specified a device with an  illegal  character
                  in its name or you did not include the colon at the end
                  of the device name.

   Recovery:      Press CTRL/H or retype  the  command  and  specify  the
                  device name with the correct characters and include the
                  colon.


                  ?  Invalid guide word   ERROR:         ?  Invalid guide word

   Reason:        You have specified a guide word that does  not  pertain
                  to   the   OPR  command  that  you  specified,  or  you
                  misspelled the guide word, or you used recognition (you
                  pressed  the  ESCape  key)  and  then  pressed <CTRL/W>
                  before you pressed the carriage return.

   Recovery:      Press CTRL/H or retype the command.  If you  must  have
                  guide  words with the OPR command, use recognition with
                  the ESCape key.


                  ?  Invalid node name   ERROR:         ?  Invalid node name

   Reason:        You have specified a node name or number  to  a  /NODE:
                  switch  that  has  not been enabled, does not exist, is
                  currently off-line, or has been misspelled.

   Recovery:      Press CTRL/H or retype  the  command  and  specify  the
                  correct node name or number to the /NODE:  switch.  You
                  might have to ENABLE the node before  you  reissue  the
                  command.


                  ?  Invalid OPR Command Specified "command"|  ERROR:         ?  Invalid OPR Command Specified "command"

   Reason:        You have specified an invalid OPR command.

   Recovery:      Type a question mark to the OPR prompt to get a list of
                  valid OPR commands.


                  ?  Invalid wildcard designator   ERROR:         ?  Invalid wildcard designator

   Reason:        You have specified a wildcard character (* or %) within
                  a file specification for a keyword or switch value.

   Recovery:      Press CTRL/H or retype the command and specify the file
                  specification    without   any   wildcard   characters.
                  OPR/ORION will not accept  wildcard  characters  within

|  Recovery:      Give the HELP HELP command  to  get  a  list  of  valid
|                 keywords (OPR commands) to the HELP command.


                  ?  No such filename   ERROR:         ?  No such filename

   Reason:        You have specified a filename as a  keyword  or  switch
                  value, but the filename does not exist as you specified
                  it.

   Recovery:      Press CTRL/H or retype  the  command  and  specify  the
                  correct filename as the keyword or switch value.


                  ?  No such file type "file-name"|  ERROR:         ?  No such file type "file-name"

   Reason:        You have specified a file type as a keyword  or  switch
                  value,  but  the  file  type  does  not  exist  as  you
                  specified it.

   Recovery:      Press CTRL/H or retype  the  command  and  specify  the
                  correct file type as the keyword or switch value.


                  ?  Not a quoted string - does  not  begin  with  double   ERROR:         ?  Not a quoted string - does  not  begin  with  double
                  quote                  quote

   Reason:        You have specified a message text, but did not  include

                           aborted.  That is, there  will  be  no  header

        When you use the READER keyword, the only switches available  are
        the  /NODE:   and  /REASON:   switches.  This is because a reader
        input job does not become a request until  the  last  card  ($EOJ
        card) has been read.

        The /ERROR-PROCESSING and /NOERROR-PROCESSING switches are  valid
        only with the BATCH-STREAM keyword.

   ALIGN - ALIGNING PRINTER PAPER   ALIGN - ALIGNING PRINTER PAPER



   Function   Function

        The ALIGN command prints a "forms-alignment"  file  on  the  line
        printer so that you can align the paper.

        At various times, you may have  to  align  special  forms  for  a
        particular  line-printer job, such as payroll checks or invoices.
        The ALIGN command allows you, at these times, to adjust the forms
        and  the  line printer, if need be, as many times as necessary to
        print the job correctly.

   BACKSPACE - BACKSPACING FILES BY PAGE   BACKSPACE - BACKSPACING FILES BY PAGE



   Function   Function

        The BACKSPACE  command  reprints  pages  in  the  file  currently
        printing on the line printer.

        At various times, you may have to  backspace  a  particular  file
        that  is currently being printed on the line printer, for example
        when the forms become jammed  in  the  printing  mechanism.   The
        BACKSPACE  command allows you to backspace the print file so that
        the pages of the file that were jammed  or  miscorrectly  printed
        can be repeated.

        /NODE:node-name::  specifies the name of  your  host  node  or  a
                           remote station.  The default is your own node.

|                          is optional.

        You must specify one of the following switches:

        /COPIES:nnnn       specifies the number of additional  copies  to
                           be  printed.   The number you specify is added
                           to the number of copies that the  user  queued
                           with  the  PRINT  command.   For example, if a
                           user issues the command:

                                PRINT FOO.BAR/COPIES:25

                           and  you  issue  the  BACKSPACE  command  with
                           /COPIES:10  while  FOO.BAR  is printing on the
                           line  printer,  the  total  number  of  copies
                           printed will be 35.

        /FILE              specifies that one file be backspaced  when  a
                           multi-file  PRINT  request has been given by a
                           user.  For  example,  if  a  user  issues  the
                           command:

                                PRINT FOO1.BAR,FOO2.BAR,FOO3.BAR

                           and you issue the BACKSPACE command with /FILE
                           while   FOO3.BAR   is  printing  on  the  line
                           printer, FOO2.BAR will be printed again.

        /PAGES:nnnn        specifies the number of pages to be backspaced
                           for  the file that is currently being printed.
                           The /PAGES:  switch  is  the  default  of  the
                           BACKSPACE  command.   If  you  do  not specify
                           either the /COPIES:  or the /FILE switch, then
                           you  must  specify  the  /PAGES:  switch.  The
                           number  (nnnn)  you  specify  refers  to   the
                           physical number of pages and not to the number
                           of pages that contains the file on disk.

   CANCEL - CANCELING REQUESTS   CANCEL - CANCELING REQUESTS



   Function   Function

        The  CANCEL  command  cancels  any  job  request  that  is  being
        processed or is waiting to be processed.  In addition, the CANCEL
        command can be used to cancel any user's request for  a  tape  or
        structure mount.

        When a user submits a request for a job  to  be  processed  or  a
        request  to  mount  a  tape  or  structure,  the system assigns a
        request number to the request.  To display the  requests  at  any
        time,  give  the  OPR  command SHOW QUEUES.  The requests will be
        displayed with the request numbers and the names of the users who
        submitted the jobs.  You cancel requests by specifying either the
        request number or the user name.  Optionally, you can cancel  all
        requests for a particular device or those of a particular type on
        the specified device.

   CLOSE - CLOSING THE LOG BUFFER FILE   CLOSE - CLOSING THE LOG BUFFER FILE



   Function   Function

        The CLOSE command closes the current ORION log  buffer  file  and
        creates a new log buffer file.  The closed log file is written to
        disk so that you can copy or print an up-to-date file.

        The ORION log buffer file records all OPR-to-ORION  commands  and
        transactions performed at the operator's console.  When the CLOSE
        command  is  issued,  these   commands   and   transactions   are
        transferred  to  the ORION-SYSTEM.LOG file and the buffer file is
        cleared.  You can then print the  ORION-SYSTEM.LOG  file  on  the
        line printer to obtain a hard-copy of all the operating processes
        for a given time period.

        You may choose a name other than ORION-SYSTEM.LOG for  the  ORION
        log  buffer  file at GALGEN time.  Please see your System Manager
        in reference to GALGEN.

                           Section  2.10.   To stop the logging facility,
                           you must give  the  DISABLE  LOGGING  command.
                           The  DISABLE  LOGGING  command is described in

        AUTOMATIC-VOLUME-RECOGNITION

                           specifies that  this  AVR  system  feature  be
                           disabled.   AVR  allows  you  to mount labeled
                           tapes without the need to IDENTIFY  the  tapes
                           to  the  system  with  a keyin.  When this AVR
                           feature is disabled, you  must  IDENTIFY  each
                           labeled  tape you mount.  Unlabeled tapes must
                           always be identified to the  system  with  the
|                          IDENTIFY  command.   (Refer to the description
                           of the IDENTIFY command.)

        CLASS-SCHEDULER    specifies a system program  be  disabled  that
                           allocates  portions  (or  percentages)  of the
                           central processor  unit  (CPU)  to  individual
                           groups  of  users.   These  groups  are called
                           classes and are set up by your System  Manager
                           in  the n-CONFIG.CMD file at system generation
                           time.  When the CLASS-SCHEDULER  is  disabled,
                           all  jobs  entered  into the system receive an
                           equal amount of CPU time; allocation is  on  a
                           first-come-first-served basis.

        FILE-RETRIEVAL-WAIT

                           specifies  that  when  a  user  or  batch  job
                           requests  a  file  that  is off-line due to an
                           archival or a migration, the job does not wait
                           until  the request has been satisfied.  (Refer

                           Instead, the user receives  an  error  message
                           indicating  that  the file cannot be retrieved
                           and the batch job ends in an error  (if  error
                           recovery has not been specified in the control
                           file).  If error recovery has  been  specified
                           in  the  control  file,  the  job continues to
                           process.

        LOGGING            specifies   that   the   centralized   logging
                           facility  of  ORION be disabled (this facility
                           logs  all   messages   passing   through   the
                           operating  system and stores these messages in
                           a log file buffer).   When  this  facility  is
                           disabled,  there  are  no  records kept of the
                           messages and interactions  between  ORION  and
                           the   system.   However,  the  CTY  shows  all
                           messages and  interactions  if  you  have  not

                           the CTY.

        OUTPUT-DISPLAY     specifies  that  the  display   of   specified
                           message groupings on your console be disabled.
                           The  groupings  are  specified  as  the  valid

        QUEUE-REQUESTS     specifies that  all  users  be  disabled  from
                           making any queue request.  When queue requests
                           are disabled, no user can submit  a  batch  or
                           reader  job,  a  card-punch, paper-tape-punch,
                           plotter, or a printer request to  the  system.
                           If  the  user  attempts to submit a job of any
                           kind, the message  "?Operator  Has  Restricted

   DISMOUNT - DISMOUNTING A STRUCTURE OR TAPE-DRIVE   DISMOUNT - DISMOUNTING A STRUCTURE OR TAPE-DRIVE



   Function   Function

        The DISMOUNT command  allows  you  to  dismount  (and  remove)  a
        structure  currently  mounted  on a disk drive or a magnetic tape
        currently mounted on a tape drive.

        When  you  issue  the  DISMOUNT  command  for  a  structure,  the
        structure is queued for removal.  If other users have mounted the
        structure, a message will ask you if you want to proceed.  If you
        answer  NO,  the  request  is  canceled.   If you answer YES, the
        structure is dismounted, and you are asked to remove it.

        When you issue the DISMOUNT command for a tape  drive,  the  tape
        rewinds  itself completely from the take-up wheel, providing that
        no user is currently using the tape.  If a user is using the tape
        on  the  specified  tape  drive,  OPR  will  reject  the DISMOUNT
        command.

|                          structure,   a   message  asks  you  to  first
|                          DISMOUNT the structure with NO-REMOVAL on  the
|                          other  CFS system.  You then respond YES or NO
|                          to the original dismount message.
|  
|                          If the structure is  not  in  use  by  another
|                          system,  the  structure  is dismounted and you
|                          are asked to remove it.
|  
|                          On a Non-CFS system, REMOVAL is the default to
|                          the STRUCTURE keyword.
|  
|       NO-REMOVAL         dismounts the structure without  checking  for
|                          use  of  the structure by users on another CFS
|                          system and prints a message telling you not to
|                          physically remove the structure.
|  
|                          On a CFS system, NO-REMOVAL is  the  STRUCTURE
|                          keyword default.

        tape-drive-name:   specifies the logical name of the  tape  drive
                           which   currently  has  the  desired  tape  to
                           dismount on it.  The colon  must  be  included
                           with  the tape drive name.  The name is in the
                           format of MTAn:, where n  is  the  tape  drive
                           number.


   Restrictions   Restrictions

        If there are other users who have mounted the structure  and  you
        really  wish  to remove the structure, it is recommended that you
        send a message to all users of the system before you respond with
        YES,  to  allow  all  users  to  complete  their  tasks  on  that
        structure.

|       A structure can be  DISMOUNTed  only  if  set  ACKNOWLEDGED;  you
|       cannot DISMOUNT a structure that is set IGNORED.

        AUTOMATIC-VOLUME-RECOGNITION

                           specifies that  this  AVR  system  feature  be
                           enabled.   AVR  allows  you  to  mount labeled
                           tapes without the need to identify  the  tapes
                           to  the  system  with  a keyin.  When this AVR
                           feature  is  enabled,  you  do  not  need   to
                           identify   each   labeled   tape   you  mount.
                           However,  unlabeled  tapes  must   always   be
                           identified  to  the  system  with the IDENTIFY
                           command.  (Refer to  the  description  of  the

                           central processor  unit  (CPU)  to  individual
                           groups  of  users.   These  groups  are called
                           classes and are set up by your System  Manager
                           in  the n-CONFIG.CMD file at system generation
                           time.  When the  CLASS-SCHEDULER  is  enabled,
                           all  jobs entered into the system are executed
                           according to their class.  You should  consult
                           your  System  Manager  before  you  ENABLE  or
                           DISABLE the  CLASS-SCHEDULER  as  this  action
                           affects the performance of your system.

        FILE-RETRIEVAL-WAIT

                           specifies  that  when  a  user  or  batch  job
                           requests  a  file  that  is off-line due to an
                           archival or a migration, the job  waits  until
                           the request has been satisfied, providing that
                           the user has given  the  TOPS-20  command  SET
                           RETRIEVAL-WAIT.    (Refer   to   the   TOPS-20
                           Operator's Guide for a discussion of  archived

                           the  SET  RETRIEVAL-WAIT  command.)  Once  the
                           request has been satisfied, the job (batch  or
                           timesharing) continues to process.

        LOGGING            specifies   that   the   centralized   logging
                           facility  of  ORION  be enabled (this facility
                           logs  all   messages   passing   through   the

                           the system.

        OUTPUT-DISPLAY     specifies  that  the  display   of   specified

                           WITHHELD.

           ALLOCATED       specifies that  excess  CPU  time  is  awarded
                           proportionately  to  the active classes (users
                           currently requesting CPU time).

           WITHHELD        specifies that excess  CPU  time  is  withheld

   ENTER - ENTERING NETWORK COMMAND LEVEL   ENTER - ENTERING NETWORK COMMAND LEVEL


   Function   Function

        The ENTER command exits OPR and enters the NCP  command  language
        for the DECnet software.  This command is applicable only if your
        installation has DECnet software.

        The ENTER command should be used  when  you  need  to  give  many
        DECnet  application  commands.   (If  you need to give only a few
        DECnet commands, you can give them at OPR command  level  without
|       entering  Network  Control Program (NCP) command level.) To enter
        NCP command level, simply  type  NCP  before  you  type  the  NCP
        command.

        When you specify the ENTER command to enter DECnet,  your  prompt
        becomes the DECnet prompt, NCP>.  Once you are in the NCP command
        level, you can use the ESCape key and recognition on the commands
        as you can for OPR commands.

        NCP has its own  set  of  commands  that  are  described  in  the
        _________  ______ _________ ___ __________ _____|       DECnet-20  System Manager's and Operator's Guide.  However, there
        are  five  NCP  commands  described  as  keywords  below.   These
        commands allow you to:

        1.  ENTER another command subset

        2.  EXIT from NCP

        3.  PUSH (return) to TOPS-20 command level

        4.  RETURN to OPR

        5.  EXECUTE NCP commands automatically

                           release of TOPS-20.

        EXIT               specifies an exit  from  NCP  and  OPR  and  a
                           return to TOPS-20 command level.  For example:

                           OPR>ENTER NCP<RET>
                           NCP>EXIT<RET>
                           $

        PUSH               specifies that you leave NCP command level and
                           enter  TOPS-20  command  level.   You can then
                           perform any software task or  run  a  utility.
                           To  return  to  NCP, you must give the TOPS-20
                           POP command.  For example:

   Function   Function

        The FORWARDSPACE command  spaces  the  print  file  on  the  line
        printer in a forward direction, so that you can skip the printing
        of a job, file, or page(s).  The FORWARDSPACE command allows  you
        to  forwardspace  the  print  file so that you can save paper and
        print only what is needed as output.

        At various times, you may have to forwardspace a particular  file
        that  is currently being printed on the line printer, for example
        when a user requires only a portion of some printed output.

                           printed will be 15.

        /FILE              specifies that you forward space one file when
                           a multi-file PRINT request has been given by a
                           user.  For  example,  if  a  user  issues  the
                           command

                           PRINT FOO1.BAR,FOO2.BAR,FOO3.BAR

                           and you issue the  FORWARDSPACE  command  with
                           /FILE  while  FOO1.BAR is printing on the line
                           printer, FOO2.BAR starts printing on the  line
                           printer.   The remaining pages of FOO1.BAR are
                           skipped.

        /PAGES:nnnn        specifies  the   number   of   pages   to   be
                           forwardspaced  for  the file that is currently
                           being printed.  If you do not  specify  either
                           the  /COPIES:   or  the /FILE switch, then you
                           must specify the /PAGES:  switch.  The  number
                           (nnnn)  you  specify  refers  to  the physical
                           number of pages and not to the number of pages
                           that contains the file on disk.

|       When you give the FORWARDSPACE PRINTER command, the system prints
|       the  output  in the printer buffer (which may contain one or more
|       printed pages) before FORWARDSPACing  the  number  of  pages  you
|       specify.   Therefore,  when  you  use  the  /PAGES:nn switch, you

   IDENTIFY - IDENTIFYING TAPE MOUNTS   IDENTIFY - IDENTIFYING TAPE MOUNTS


   Function   Function

|       The IDENTIFY command services tape mount requests by enabling you
        to:

         o  Satisfy a user's mount request for an unlabeled tape.

         o  Satisfy a user's request for a labeled tape that  is  mounted
            on a drive that has AVR disabled.

         o  Pre-place and identify an unlabeled tape.

        When a user issues a mount request for  an  unlabeled  tape,  you
        must physically locate, mount, and ready the requested tape on an
        available tape drive and then 'IDENTIFY' the  tape-mount  request
        to the tape drive.

        When more than one user issues a  mount  request  for  a  scratch
        tape,  the  IDENTIFY  SCRATCH command will apply to first request
        received.  If you need to service a request other than the first,
        use the IDENTIFY REQUEST-ID command.

        If you have AVR enabled and your installation uses labeled tapes,
        you  do not need to give the IDENTIFY command after you mount and
        ready a tape on a tape drive.

                           unlabeled, or the label must have expired.

        VOLUME-ID volid    specifies the volume identifier (volid) of the

                           drive.  The volid can consist of from 1  to  6
                           alphanumeric   characters.    If   the   volid
                           contains      nonalphanumeric       characters

        The user who requests the job can set the priority value with the
        /PRIORITY:   switch.   However, the MODIFY command permits you to
        change the priority value for any job request.

|       The MOUNT command mounts a structure and allows users  to  access
|       it.  Give the MOUNT command after physically mounting a structure
|       or after a physically mounted structure has been  DISMOUNTed  but
|       not  removed  from the disk drive.  The MOUNT command also allows
|       you  to  assign  the  structure  an  alias  name  when  two  file
|       structures have the same name.
|  
|       Unlike the EXEC MOUNT command, the OPR  MOUNT  command  does  not
|       place  a  mount  request  in the mount queue or identify you as a
|       user of the structure.  If the structure is physically mounted in
|       the  drive,  the  MOUNT  command is executed immediately.  If the
|       structure is not mounted  in  the  drive,  you  receive  a  MOUNT
|       request.   The  MOUNT command is then executed automatically when
|       the structure is physically mounted.
|  
|       The structure is MOUNTed only when it is physically mounted in  a
|       disk drive and has AVAILABLE and ACKNOWLEDGED attributes.

        software task.

        When a user or software task sends you a message that requires  a
        response,  OPR  assigns the message a number so that you can keep
        track of all messages sent to operations.  With the  use  of  the
        SHOW  MESSAGES command, you can find out at any time if there are
        any outstanding messages.

        There are no keywords or switches for the  RESPOND  command,  but
        you  must  specify the message number.  Also, you may be required
        to include a message; therefore you may specify a message in  the

   ROUTE - ROUTING OUTPUT BETWEEN NODES   ROUTE - ROUTING OUTPUT BETWEEN NODES



   Function   Function

        The ROUTE command changes the destination of output requests,  so
        that  the  output  intended for a specific unit (the source unit)
        will automatically be output on  another  unit  (the  destination
        unit).  The source and destination units may be on the same node,
        or they may be on different nodes.

        This function is useful when a unit malfunctions and  the  output
        from that device is immediately necessary.

        If you are an operator at a central site, you  can  route  output
        from  one  unit  to  another,  on  the  same  or  any other node.
        However, output cannot be processed on another host  system.   If
        output is routed to another host node, the request(s) will remain
        in  the  queue  indefinitely,  because  the  request  cannot   be
        processed.   If  you  are  an  operator at a remote node, you can
        route requests from one unit to another on your node.

        All device routing is entered into the system route table,  which
        can be examined using the OPR command SHOW ROUTE-TABLE, described
        in this chapter.  The  ROUTE  command  also  allows  you  to  end
        routing  and  delete  the  entry  from the system route table, by
        omitting the information pertaining to  the  destination  unit(s)
        and node.

        The source-information is  always  required.   It  specifies  the
        source unit and node from which routing is to occur.

        The  destination-information  is  optional,  and  specifies   the
        destination  unit  and node to which routing is to occur.  If you
        omit the destination-information, any  existing  entries  in  the
        system  route table that refer to the source will be deleted, and
        the appropriate routing will be ended.

        Because the format and  arguments  used  with  the  ROUTE  depend
        largely on the keyword you use, it is highly recommended that you
        use the recognition feature (<ESC>) until  you  feel  comfortable
        with the command format.

   Function   Function

        The SET command sets various system parameters for  the  system's
        devices and features.

        In addition, the SET command can be issued  before  a  particular
        device  (queue) or stream has been started or becomes active.  In
        particular, the SET command is very useful within the  PTYCON.ATO
        file  for system start-up and it can be used during normal system
        operation as well.

        Because the  SET  command  is  complex  with  multiple  keywords,
|       arguments, switches, and numeric values, each SET keyword command
|       is described in the same format as individual OPR commands.

   Arguments   Arguments

        nn                 specifies a batch-stream number.   The  number
                           is  usually  from 0 to 5, but can be larger if
                           your  installation   uses   additional   batch
                           streams.

        n:m                specifies a range of batch streams.

        ATTRIBUTE          specifies whether the  batch  stream  operates
                           with the BATCON or with the SITGO program.

             BATCON        specifies that the batch stream use the BATCON
                           controller.   This is the system default batch
                           controller.

             SITGO         specifies the  SITGO  batch  processor,  which
                           consists   of  a  fast  FORTRAN  compiler  for
                           compiling FORTRAN programs in a batch stream.

        NOOPR-INTERVENTION specifies that a user cannot make any requests
                           in  the  batch job that require you to perform
                           an action of some kind or require you to  send
                           a    message.     If    a    batch   job   has
                           NOOPR-INTERVENTION set, any messages it  sends
                           are  ignored  and you are not asked to perform
                           any  action.   If  the  batch   job   requests
                           mountable  devices,  and  if the job must wait
                           until the device  is  mounted,  the  job  will
                           receive an error.

        OPR-INTERVENTION   specifies that the user can pass  messages  to
                           you  and  that  you  are  available to perform
                           actions that a user or batch job requests.

        PRIORITY-LIMITS nn specifies  the  priority  limits  of  a  batch
                           stream  or  a  range  of  batch streams at the
                           central site or at a node.  The numeric  value
                           associated  with this argument means that only
                           batch  jobs  submitted  by  users   with   the
                           /PRIORITY:   switch  specifying the number (or
                           range)  you  set  for  the  batch  stream  can
                           execute in that stream.  The numeric value for
                           the PRIORITY-LIMITS argument can be from 1  to
                           63.   The  higher  the  number, the higher the
                           priority.

        TIME-LIMITS nn     specifies the maximum execution time limit for
                           a  given  batch  stream  or  a  range of batch
                           streams.  When a  batch  job  enters  a  batch
                           stream,  it receives a default execution time,
                           such as five minutes.  If the job exceeds this
                           time  limit  and if the user who submitted the
                           batch job set up his control  file  to  handle
                           time limits, the batch system gives the job an
                           additional 10% of the allocated time.  If  the
                           job  exceeds  this  additional 10%, the job is
                           canceled.  The TIME-LIMITS argument allows you
                           to specify that batch jobs that are set to run
                           a certain length  of  time  will  run  in  the
                           specified batch-stream number (or range).  The
                           numeric value for the TIME-LIMITS argument can

   Function   Function

        The SET CARD-PUNCH  command  specifies  what  kind  of  jobs  are
        scheduled  on  this  device.   You  can set the form type, output
        limits (card limits), priority limits, and the action to be taken
        when  a  job  exceeds  the  output  limit that you specify.  This
        command allows you to change  the  parameters  that  are  set  at
        GALGEN  time.   You can specify a specific unit number or a range
        of unit numbers.

        The card-punch device handles standard 12-row 80-column cards.

        The defaults for the card punch are set by your System Manager at
        software-installation   time   through   the  generation  of  the
        <SYSTEM>SPFORM.INI file.

        FORMS-TYPE name    specifies the name of the type  of  card-punch
                           forms.   Your  installation can have different

                           By  setting the FORMS-TYPE, you are specifying
                           the type of forms in the card punch.

        LIMIT-EXCEEDED-ACTION word

                           specifies what action, if any, should be taken

                           output.  You then have the option to  continue
                           or abort the card-punch job.

             CANCEL        specifies   that   the   card-punch   job   is
                           automatically canceled when the limit has been
                           exceeded.

             IGNORE        specifies that the  card-punch  job  continues

                           output.   This  argument  can  also  specify a
                           range of card limits.  The card  limit  refers
                           to   the  number  of  output  cards  that  are
                           punched.  This command restricts the  size  of

        nn                 specifies  a  job  number  currently  in   the
                           system.   The  numeric  value can be from 0 to
                           99999.

        NOOPR-INTERVENTION specifies that a user cannot make any requests
                           in  the  job  that  require  you to perform an
                           action of some kind and/or produce  a  message

                           NOOPR-INTERVENTION setting, the  messages  are
                           ignored;  you  are  not  asked  to perform any
                           action.

        OPR-INTERVENTION   specifies that  a  user  associated  with  the
                           specified  job number can pass messages to you
                           and you can perform the requested actions.

                           2 for a unit with no multi-record feature

                           7 for  a  unit  like  an  IBM  2780  with  the

        TIMEOUT-CATEGORY PRIMARY
                         SECONDARY

                           specifies the timeout category used by the BSC
                           protocol  to  determine how connecting systems
                           bid for use of the line.  Two systems  bidding
                           for  the use of a line must not be in the same
                           timeout category,  since  this  condition  can
                           result  in  simultaneous bids for a line and a
                           "deadly embrace".  To prevent this, one system
                           is  placed in the PRIMARY (p) category and the
                           other in the SECONDARY (s) category.

                           The timeout category for the HASP  spooler  is
                           always  SECONDARY  so  when  the  TOPS-20 host
                           connects to a HASP system, it must  be  placed
                           in  the PRIMARY timeout category.  The timeout
                           category for IBM 2780s and  3780s  is  usually
                           hardwired as PRIMARY, so when the TOPS-20 host
                           connects  to  stations  like  these,  it  must
                           usually  be  placed  in  the SECONDARY timeout
                           category.  The timeout category  for  the  ASP
                           spooler  may  be PRIMARY.  The default timeout
                           category is PRIMARY.

   Function   Function

|       The SET ONLINE command sets the devices listed below on-line when
        the  device  has  been  newly  installed at your operations site.
        This command is valid only  if  your  site  has  a  DX20  channel
        controller installed and on-line.

        The devices that are interfaced through the DX20 are:

        1.  TX01 - tape controller

        2.  TX03 - channel selector

        3.  TX05 - tape drive selector

        4.  TU70 - tape drive

        5.  TU71 - tape drive

        6.  TU72 - tape drive

        In addition, this command is helpful when Field Service takes one
        of  these devices off-line for repair and then returns the device
        back to you for your control.

        The SET ONLINE command's arguments  are  channel  number,  device
|       unit  number, and controller number, separated by commas.  If the
|       device has no controller number, type -1.

                                      NOTE

                This  command  currently  accepts  an   alternate
                channel   number,   device   unit   number,   and
                controller number separated by commas.   However,
                these  alternate  arguments  are  not used by the
                system and are provided for future use.

   Function   Function

|       The SET PAPER-TAPE-PUNCH command specifies what kind of jobs will
        be  scheduled on this device.  You can set the forms type, output
        limits (fold limits), priority limits, and the action to be taken
        when  a  job  exceeds  the  output  limit that you specify.  This
        command allows you change the parameters that are set  at  GALGEN
        time.   You can specify a specific unit number or a range of unit
        numbers.

        The defaults for the paper-tape punch  are  set  by  your  System
        Manager  at  software-installation time through the generation of
        the  <SYSTEM>SPFORM.INI  file.   These  defaults   are   normally
        referred to as NORMAL in most installations.

        FORMS-TYPE name    specifies the name of the type  of  paper-tape
                           forms.   Typically  in some installations, the
                           normal paper-tape form is  referred  to  as  a
                           1-inch  wide  fan-fold, and can be abbreviated
                           as 1WFF or NORMAL.  Your installation can have

                           possible    words    associated    with    the
                           LIMIT-EXCEEDED-ACTION argument.  They are:

             ASK           specifies that you are asked what to do if the
                           paper-tape  job  exceeds  the  fold  limit  on
                           output.  You then have the option to  continue
                           or abort the paper-tape job.

             CANCEL        specifies   that   the   paper-tape   job   is
                           automatically canceled when the limit has been
                           exceeded.

             IGNORE        specifies that the  paper-tape  job  continues
                           automatically  and  the  specified output fold
                           limit will be ignored.

        OUTPUT-LIMITS folds

                           specifies the maximum fold limit  for  punched
                           paper-tape  output.   This  argument  can also
                           specify a range  of  fold  limits.   The  fold
                           limit  refers  to  the  number of output folds
                           that are punched.  This command restricts  the

   SET PLOTTER - Setting Plotter Parameters   SET PLOTTER - Setting Plotter Parameters



   Function   Function

|       The SET PLOTTER command specifies what kind of jobs are scheduled
        on  this device.  You can set the forms type, output limits (step
        limits), priority limits, and the action to be taken when  a  job
        exceeds  the  output limit that you specify.  This command allows
        you change the parameters that are set at GALGEN time.   You  can
        specify a specific unit number or a range of unit numbers.

        The   plotter   device   draws   (or   plots)   ink   plots    of
        computer-generated data.  Its movement in producing the output is
        measured in "steps".  The steps refer to the speed per second  of
        the  plotter  and the distance (or size) that the pencils move on
        the output paper.  The paper for the plotter is either drum  feed
        or bed feed.

        The defaults for the plotter are set by your  System  Manager  at
        software-installation   time   through   the  generation  of  the
        <SYSTEM>SPFORM.INI file.   At  some  installations,  the  default

                           You then have the option to continue or  abort
                           the plotter job.

             CANCEL        specifies   that   the    plotter    job    is
                           automatically canceled when the limit has been

        OUTPUT-LIMIT steps specifies the  number  of  plotter  steps  per
                           second.  A step is the horizontal and vertical
                           movement of the pen within  the  grid  on  the
                           paper.   This  is  referred to as the size (or
                           distance).  The number you specify  represents
                           nnK   steps   (K   =   1000).    For  example,
                           OUTPUT-LIMIT 3 is equal to 3000.

                           can  be  from  1 to 63.  The higher the number
                           is, the higher the priority is.

   SET PRINTER - Setting Line Printer Parameters   SET PRINTER - Setting Line Printer Parameters



   Function   Function

        The SET PRINTER command specifies what kind of jobs are scheduled
        on  this  device.   You  can  set  the  forms  type, page limits,
        priority limits, and the action to be taken when  a  job  exceeds
        the  output  limit  that you specify.  This command allows you to
        change the parameters that are  set  at  GALGEN  time.   You  can
        specify  a  specific  unit number or a range of unit numbers.  In
        addition, you can  specify  ranges  for  the  page  and  priority
        limits.

        The defaults for the line printers at your installation  are  set
        by  your System Manager at software-installation time through the
        generation of the  <SYSTEM>n-CONFIG.CMD  file  (where  n  is  the
        TOPS-20  software  generation  number) and the <SYSTEM>LPFORM.INI
        file.  These defaults are usually referred to as NORMAL  in  most
        installations.

        The printer is also commonly referred to as the line printer.

        There are two basic types of line printers, those that  print  in
        uppercase  characters  only  (64  character print drum) and those
        that  print  in  both  uppercase  and  lowercase  characters  (96
        character print drum).

   Arguments   Arguments

        nn                 specifies a printer unit number.   The  number
                           is  usually  from 0 to 5, but can be larger if
                           your installation has  acquired  more  printer
                           devices.

        n:m                specifies a range of printer unit numbers.


        FORMS-TYPE name    specifies the name  of  the  type  of  printer
                           forms.   Typically,  the normal paper form for
                           the printer is referred to  as  1-ply-wide  or
                           1-ply-narrow.   These can be abbreviated as 1W
                           or 1N, or can be given some other name by your
                           System  Manager.   Your  installation can have
                           different  names  for   different   types   of
                           line-printer    forms.     By    setting   the
                           FORMS-TYPE, you are  specifying  the  type  of
                           forms in the line printer.

        LIMIT-EXCEEDED-ACTION word

                           specifies what action, if any, should be taken
                           if a printer job that is currently printing on
                           the  unit  number  you  specify  exceeds   the
                           specified  limit  of output.  The limit is set
                           with  the  PAGE-LIMITS  argument.   There  are
                           three   possible  words  associated  with  the
                           LIMIT-EXCEEDED-ACTION argument.  They are:

             ASK           specifies that you are asked what to do if the
                           printer  job exceeds the page limit on output.
                           You then have the option to continue or  abort
                           the printer job.

             CANCEL        specifies that the print job is  automatically
                           canceled when the limit has been exceeded.

             IGNORE        specifies  that  the   print   job   continues
                           automatically  and  the  specified output page
                           limit is ignored.

        PAGE-LIMITS pages  specifies the maximum page limit  for  printed
                           output.   This  argument  can  also  specify a
                           range of page limits.  The page  limit  refers
                           to   the  number  of  output  pages  that  are
                           printed.  This command restricts the  size  of
                           jobs that are sent to the printer you specify.

                           specifies   the   priority   limits   (numeric
                           importance)  of  a  line printer or a range of
                           line printers at the  central  site  or  at  a
                           node.   The numeric value associated with this
                           argument  means   that   only   printer   jobs
                           submitted by users with the /PRIORITY:  switch
                           specifying the number (or range) you  set  for
                           the  line printer can execute on that printer.
                           The  numeric  value  for  the  PRIORITY-LIMITS
                           argument  can be from 1 to 63.  The higher the
                           number is, the higher the priority is.

   SET SCHEDULER - Setting System Performance   SET SCHEDULER - Setting System Performance



   Function   Function

        The SET SCHEDULER  command  changes  the  scheduling  scheme  (or
        allocation  of  system  resources) for batch jobs and timesharing
        jobs.

        Normally, if your installation is making use of the TOPS-20 class
        scheduling  of  jobs,  the  scheduling  classes are set up in the
        n-CONFIG.CMD file at system startup.  The SET  SCHEDULER  command
        allows  you  to  change these classes during timesharing, such as
        when first shift ends and second shift begins.

        You should refer to your  System  Manager  about  job  scheduling
        before you use this command with any of its available arguments.

                           processing.   With  this  argument   you   can

                           resources   between   compute-bound  jobs  and
                           interactive jobs be changed.  The  "nn"  is  a
                           integer from 1 to 20 that determines which job
                           grouping  receives   the   higher   or   lower
                           priority.   To  allocate  a higher priority to
                           compute-bound jobs, set the integer in the  11
                           to   20   range  with  20  being  the  highest
                           priority.  To allocate a  higher  priority  to
                           interactive  jobs, set the integer in the 1 to
                           10 range with 1 being  the  highest  priority.
                           The  default  is set by your System Manager at
                           system  installation  time.   To   check   the
                           current  setting of the bias control, give the
                           SHOW SCHEDULER command.

        CLASS n nn         specifies the percentage of  CPU  time  for  a
                           particular   job   class   be   changed.   The
                           percentage (nn) cannot exceed a 100% total for
                           all  classes  in the system.  The class number
                           (n) can be from 0 to 7.  To check the  current
                           settings  of  the classes in your system, give

   Function   Function

        The SET TAPE-DRIVE command sets the availability  characteristics
        of a particular tape-drive device.  With the use of this command,
        you can allow or disallow  users  from  requesting  tapes  to  be
        mounted  on  the  tape  drives.   In addition, you can initialize
        tapes with the SET TAPE-DRIVE  command.   You  must  specify  the
        logical  tape-drive  name,  and  either  the  keyword  AVAILABLE,
        INITIALIZE, or UNAVAILABLE.

        where MTAn: is the logical tape-drive name

        followed by one of these arguments:

                                             AVAILABLE

        MTAn:              specifies the  logical  tape-drive  name;  the

                           tape-drive  number.   An  example of a logical
                           tape-drive name is MTA0:   for  Magnetic  Tape
                           Drive 0.


   Arguments   Arguments

        AVAILABLE          specifies that this particular tape drive  can
                           be  used  to satisfy user tape mount requests.
                           This  argument  cancels  the  effect  of   the
                           UNAVAILABLE  argument.   Once  this command is
                           given, the tape drive remains AVAILABLE  until
                           it is set UNAVAILABLE.

        INITIALIZE         specifies that the tape drive  is  unavailable
                           for  user mount requests and that the drive is
                           being used by  you  to  initialize  tapes.   A
                           labeled  tape  is initialized when you write a
                           volume identification at the beginning of  the
                           tape.   An  unlabeled tape is initialized when
                           you write a record of 80  null  characters  at
                           the beginning of the tape.  When the specified
                           number of tapes  have  been  INITIALIZEd,  the
                           tape drive automatically becomes available for
                           user mount requests.  You specify  the  number
                           of  tapes  to  be initialized with the /COUNT:
                           switch.

        UNAVAILABLE        specifies  that  this  particular  tape  drive
                           cannot  be  used  to  satisfy  user tape mount
                           requests.  This argument cancels the effect of
                           the   AVAILABLE  argument.   If  the  user  is
                           currently using a tape on this tape drive, the
                           tape  drive becomes unavailable after the user
                           completes his work.  If the system crashes  or
                           is  shutdown, the command SET TAPE-DRIVE MTAn:
                           UNAVAILABLE remains in effect after the system
                           is in operation again.

                                                NOTE

                               Drives that are set UNAVAILABLE can be
                               ASSIGNed  by  user  jobs.   This could
                               pose a security problem, as  no  label
                               processing    or    verification    is
                               performed by the system when  using  a
                               tape on an UNAVAILABLE drive.

                           When you specify UNAVAILABLE, you can enter  a
                           single-  or multiple-line reason and terminate
                           with a carriage return, or you  can  terminate
                           immediately  with  a carriage return after the

                           enter as many lines of text for  a  reason  as
                           you  need.   When  you  press CTRL/Z, the OPR>
                           prompt returns and your report is logged  into
                           the ERROR.SYS file.


   Switches   Switches

        /COUNT:nn          specifies the  number  (nn)  of  tapes  to  be
                           initialized.    The   /COUNT:    switch,  when
                           specified,   provides    a    mechanism    for
                           initialization of multiple tapes with the same
                           attributes.  Each tape prompts you with a WTOR
                           message  for the volume identification.  After
                           initialization,  the  tape  is   automatically
                           unloaded and the tape drive is ready to accept
                           the next tape to  initialize.   When  as  many
                           tapes as specified by the /COUNT:  switch have
                           been initialized, the tape  drive  returns  to
                           the AVAILABLE state.

        /DENSITY:nn        specifies the BPI (bits-per-inch)  density  of
                           the  tapes to be initialized.  The number (nn)
                           can be 200, 556, 800, 1600, or 6250.   If  you
                           do  not  specify  the  /DENSITY:   switch, the
                           density defaults to 1600 BPI.

        /INCREMENT:nn      specifies the numeric value (nn) to  increment
                           the  tape  volumes  by.   This switch is valid
|                          only when used with the /COUNT:  Switch and  a
|                          numeric  volume identification.  If you do not
                           include this switch, the default numeric value
                           is 1.

        /LABEL-TYPE:type   specifies the type of label to be  written  on
                           the  tape.   The  type  can  be  ANSI, EBCDIC,
                           TOPS-20, or UNLABELED.  If you do not  specify
                           the   /LABEL-TYPE:   switch,  the  default  is
                           TOPS-20.

        /OVERRIDE-EXPIRATION: (YES or NO)

                           specifies whether to check for expiration date
                           of  the  data  on the tape.  If you specify NO
                           and attempt to re-initialize  a  labeled  tape
                           whose  first  file  is not expired, the system
                           issues  an  error   message   and   does   not
                           re-initialize  the  tape.  If you specify YES,
                           each tape is  re-initialized  unconditionally.
                           If  you  are initializing brand new tapes, you

                          OPR COMMAND DESCRIPTIONS                          OPR COMMAND DESCRIPTIONS


                           should specify YES to prevent the  tape  drive
                           from  "running away" when MOUNTR tries to read
                           a label from the tape.  If you do not  specify
                           this switch, the default is NO.

        /OWNER:name        specifies the name of the owner of the tape(s)
                           to  be  initialized.  This switch affects only
                           to TOPS-20 label types.  If you do not specify
                           the  /OWNER:   switch, the tape is initialized
                           as a scratch tape.

        /PROTECTION:nnnnnn specifies  a  6-digit  octal  number  as   the
                           protection  number of the tape.  The number is
                           usually from 000000 (so that no  one  can  use
                           the tape) through 777777 (where anyone can use
                           the  tape).   If  you  do  not   specify   the
                           /PROTECTION:   switch,  the default is 777777.
                           This switch is ignored if the  label  type  is
                           ANSI, EBCDIC, or UNLABELED.

        /TAPE-DISPOSITION:condition

                           specifies what is to be done to the tape after
                           it  is  initialized.   The  condition  can  be
                           either HOLD or UNLOAD.  If you  specify  HOLD,
                           the  tape  is initialized and is not unloaded.
                           A user requesting the tape can use it  without
                           your  having  to  reload  it.   If you specify
                           UNLOAD,  the  tape  is  initialized   and   is
                           unloaded  from the tape drive.  The default is
                           UNLOAD.   If  a  value  greater  than   1   is
                           specified   by   the   /COUNT:    switch,  the
                           /TAPE-DISPOSITION:   switch  is  ignored   and
                           UNLOAD is assumed.

        /VOLUME-ID:"volid" specifies  a  volume  identification  for  the
|                          tape.    The   volid  must  be  from  1  to  6
|                          characters.    The   volid   cannot    contain
|                          nonalphanumeric  characters.   This  switch is
                           not necessary if the tape is being initialized
                           as an unlabeled tape.

        1.  A user (J.JONES) has requested a tape mount of an  ANSI  tape
            with  a volid of FOOBAR and has requested that you initialize
            the tape first.  The volume is initialized with  ANSI  labels
            and  a volid of FOOBAR.  The system default for density (1600
            BPI) is used.  When the tape is mounted  on  the  drive,  the
            tape  is  initialized and the drive then becomes available to
            the  user  (/TAPE-DISPOSITION:HOLD).   AVR  takes  over   and
            satisfies the mount request for FOOBAR.

   SHOW - DISPLAYING SYSTEM INFORMATION   SHOW - DISPLAYING SYSTEM INFORMATION



   Function   Function

        The SHOW command shows (or displays) information from the system.
        The  SHOW  command  does not alter or change any jobs, queues, or
        devices.  The SHOW command can be issued before a particular job,
        queue,  or  device  has  been  changed; and then it can be issued
        after the change to check to see if  the  particular  change  was
        satisfactory.

        Because the SHOW command is complex,  having  multiple  keywords,
|       subkeywords,  parameters, switches, and numeric values, each SHOW
|       keyword command is described in the same format as an  individual
|       OPR command.

   Function   Function

        The SHOW CONTROL-FILE command displays  the  control  file  of  a
        batch  job  that is processing in a particular batch stream.  The
        only keyword for this command is  BATCH-STREAM  followed  by  the
        stream number.  You must specify the BATCH-STREAM keyword.

        Some of the advantages of this command is that it enables you  to
        display  a  particular stream while the job is processing, to see
        any possible problems that might come about due to  an  incorrect
        command, and to check whether there are any commands that require
        an operator action of some kind.

        The  SHOW  PARAMETERS  command  displays  information   about   a

        input/output unit number, or all devices known to the system.

        The SHOW PARAMETERS command is  very  useful  when  you  want  to
        change  the  defaults of a particular device.  You can issue this
        command to check the parameters before and after the changes have
        been made.

   Function   Function

        The SHOW QUEUES  command  displays  the  job  requests  that  are
        active, that are waiting to be processed, and that are being held
        and must be rescheduled.  You can specify all jobs in all  queues
        or  only  those  jobs in a particular queue.  The default for the
        SHOW QUEUES command is ALL-JOBS.

        A queue is a list of jobs for a particular device or stream  that
        are  processing,  are  waiting to be processed, or are being held
        for rescheduling.

        The asterisk (*) before the job name in the output display of the
        SHOW  QUEUES  command indicates that the job request is currently
        active.

   Function   Function

        The SHOW SCHEDULER command displays the current settings  of  the
        scheduling  scheme  for  your  system.  The parameters and values
        shown in the display are  set  by  your  System  Manager  in  the
        n-CONFIG.CMD   file   at   system  installation  time.   You  can
        optionally change these  settings  with  the  SET  SCHEDULER  and
        ENABLE CLASS-SCHEDULER commands.

        The scheduler information display shows the following  parameters
        and values:

        1.  the class scheduler setting (on or off)

        2.  the bias control setting

        3.  the batch class setting

        4.  the class number with its share (percentage) of CPU time, its
            use  percentage,  and load averages in intervals of 1, 5, and
            15 minutes

        5.  windfall setting (allocated or withheld)

        6.  the classes setting (by account or by policy program)

        Refer to the SET SCHEDULER and  ENABLE  CLASS-SCHEDULER  commands
        for a description of these parameters and values.

   SHOW STATUS - Displaying Device/System Information   SHOW STATUS - Displaying Device/System Information



   Function   Function

|       The SHOW STATUS command displays the current information about  a
        particular device or range of devices, showing its current status
        within the  system.   The  device  can  be  a  batch  stream,  an
|       input/output  unit number, a tape-drive name, a structure name, a
        node, or all current devices known to the system.

        The SHOW STATUS command is useful  when  you  want  to  know  the
        current  status  of  the  system.   You can issue this command to
        check whether any devices are active or idle.

        If you do not specify any keyword with the SHOW  STATUS  command,
        the command defaults to batch streams, printers, and readers.  If
        your installation has a card punch, paper-tape punch, or plotter,
        the status of these devices are also displayed when no keyword is
        specified.

                           AVR  status,  the  label-type, and the density
                           (BPI).  If you do not specify the /ALL switch,
                           the  additional information does not appear in
                           the status display.

        /CHARACTERISTICS   specifies that the status display contain  the
                           characteristics of all tape drives or one tape
                           drive if  you  specify  the  tape  drive  name
                           (MTAn:).    The  characteristics  include  the
|                          drive name, the model name (TU45, TU78  etc.),
                           the  type  of  drive (7-track or 9-track), and
                           the tape densities the drive accepts.

        /FREE              specifies that the status display contain  all
                           tape  drives  that  are currently unloaded and
                           available  for  mounting  tape  volumes.   The
                           /FREE  switch  also displays those tape drives
                           that are loaded, but are not being accessed by
                           any user.

   SUPPRESS - SUPPRESSING PRINTER FORM-FEEDS   SUPPRESS - SUPPRESSING PRINTER FORM-FEEDS



   Function   Function

        The  SUPPRESS  command  converts  all  vertical-form-feed  motion
        characters  to  single  space  characters.   All  form  feeds and
        multiple line feeds are converted to a single line  feed.   Thus,
        the  paging motion in a printer-job request is ignored.  However,
        this command does not cause printing to occur  across  the  forms
        page burst (perforation).

        The SUPPRESS command is very useful  when  you  want  to  stop  a
        user's  program  that  caused  a print loop, for example when bad
        code causes too many form feeds.  When this happens, you can stop
        the  printer,  issue  the SUPPRESS command, and then continue the
        printer, thus saving a lot of paper.

        The SUPPRESS command's only keyword  is  PRINTER  with  its  unit
        number  and,  optionally,  the  node  name  or  number.  You must
        specify the PRINTER keyword.

                           files.    (Refer   to   the   BACKSPACE    and

                           regardless of how many files or switches  were
                           specified  when  the job was originally queued
                           to print.  The /JOB switch is the  default  of
                           the SUPPRESS command.

        /STOP              specifies  a  switch  used  to  resume  normal
                           printing  and stop the suppression of carriage
                           control on the line printer.  When you specify
                           this   switch,   the  job  that  is  currently
                           printing reverts to the print job format  that

   Function   Function

|       The SWITCH command switches a tape-mount request from one  volume
        to another that is on another tape drive.  This command should be
        used when a user program wishes to switch volumes without issuing
        another tape MOUNT request.

        In particular, this command is useful when  you  want  to  handle
        tape  volume  switching for unlabeled tapes used by certain COBOL
        programs.

        The following list are the restrictions for the SWITCH command:

        1.  You must specify a new volid.

        2.  The tape drive name is optional.  If specified, it must be  a
            drive  other  than  the  drive  that the request is currently
            using.  If not specified, the drive must  be  the  same  tape
            drive.

        3.  If you give a drive  name,  you  must  have  the  new  volume
            mounted and ready on the tape drive.

        4.  The switched tape and tape drive must be the same  track-type
            and density.

                           the TAKE command.

        /NODISPLAY         specifies that OPR does not  display  the  OPR

   WAIT - CONTROLLING OUTPUT TO BATCH JOBS   WAIT - CONTROLLING OUTPUT TO BATCH JOBS



   Function   Function

|       The WAIT command causes OPR to wait a specified number of seconds
|       before accepting input.

        The WAIT command is used in batch control files to try to prevent
        OPR  from  accepting a command before a previously issued command
        is finished being processed.

        The OPR program  is  designed  to  accept  and  process  commands
        immediately,  and the batch system (BATCON) will send commands to
        OPR as soon as the previous command is accepted.

        Most OPR commands require processing  by  other  modules  of  the
        operating  system.   OPR can accept a command, dispatch it to the
        appropriate module, and accept another  command  from  the  batch
        file  before  the  output  from the first command returns to OPR.
        For example, it is possible for an EXIT command in the batch file
        to  be processed before the response to previously issued command
        is displayed.  The WAIT command should  be  entered  between  the
        previous command and the EXIT command, to allow the first command
        to finish processing before the EXIT command is sent to OPR.


   Format   Format

            WAIT n        OPR>WAIT n

        where n is the number of seconds  that  OPR  should  wait  before
        accepting  the  next  command  in the batch file.  The value of n
        must be between 1 and 60.


   Warning   Warning

        Using the WAIT command does NOT guarantee that  the  output  from
        the  first command will be successfully displayed before the EXIT
        command is accepted and processing by OPR.   OPR  will,  however,
        WAIT  the  specified  number  of seconds, and the output from the
        first command will  be  displayed  if  it  is  ready  before  the
        specified number of seconds is up.

   Example   Example

        The following batch file may be submitted to the batch system:

             @ENABLE
             $OPR
             *SHOW STATUS TAPE-DRIVE
             *EXIT

        When this job is processed, the SHOW STATUS command is issued and
        accepted  by  OPR,  passed  to ORION for processing, and then the
        output is passed back through OPR  to  BATCON.   However,  BATCON
        will  send  the EXIT command immediately after OPR dispatches the
        SHOW STATUS command.  When OPR  receives  the  EXIT  command,  it
        causes  the  batch  job  to exit from OPR immediately, before the
        output from SHOW STATUS is received by OPR.

        The WAIT command is used to cause OPR to WAIT for  the  specified
        number  of  seconds  before  accepting  the  EXIT  command.   The
        following batch file would probably work successfully:

             @ENABLE
             $OPR
             *SHOW STATUS TAPE-DRIVE
             *WAIT 10

   PRIVILEGED COMMAND DESCRIPTIONS   PRIVILEGED COMMAND DESCRIPTIONS

   The commands in this chapter  must  be  given  with  a  ^E  (<CTRL/E>)
   preceding  the command and these commands can affect the entire system
   or a specific user.  Thus, these commands  are  called  ^E  Privileged
   Commands.

   Because these commands can easily destroy your system security,  their
   usage  is  restricted  to users who have WHEEL or OPERATOR capability.
   WHEEL capability  allows  you  to  execute  all  privileged  commands.
   OPERATOR capability allows you to execute only the privileged commands
   relevant to system operations.

   WHEEL and OPERATOR capabilities can be  granted  when  you  create  or
   change  a  directory.   Normally,  the  user  name OPERATOR, which you
   should be using, has the OPERATOR capability.

   Before you can successfully issue a privileged command, you must  type
   the  ENABLE  command  to  enable  your capabilities.  If you are using
   recognition input, the command is ENABLE (CAPABILITIES).  Once you are
   enabled, the prompt character changes from @ to $.  For example,

        @ENABLE (CAPABILITIES)<RET>
        $

                                    NOTE

           Even if you do not have WHEEL or OPERATOR  capability,
           ENABLE changes the prompt to $.

   Once you are at privileged  command  level,  you  must  type  <CTRL/E>
   before  each  command.   The  <CTRL/E>  prints as ^E on your terminal.
   Then type the remainder of the command.  There are nine (9) privileged
   commands and most of them have subcommands.

   If you do not have the special capability needed for  the  command  or
   you have not typed ENABLE, you get the message:


                                    3-1
                           ^E PRIVILEGED COMMANDS                           ^E PRIVILEGED COMMANDS


        ?Unrecognized command

   and your terminal is at operating system command level.

   When  you  complete  a  privileged  command,  disable   your   special
   capabilities  by  typing  DISABLE.  The prompt character changes to @.
   For example,

        $DISABLE<RET>
        @

                                    NOTE

           It is very important that you give the DISABLE command
           after  you  use  a privileged command.  This safeguard
           protects you against accidentally damaging part of the
           system.

   In the following sections of  each  privileged  command,  <CTRL/E>  is
   indicated by ^E.  Where you would press the RETURN key is indicated by
   the        symbol.  You can abbreviate a privileged command by  typing
   as  few  of the beginning characters as are needed to make the command
   unique.  Recognition with  guide  words  is  given  with  the  command
   formats.

   You can easily get a list of all ^E commands by typing ENABLE<RET> AND
   THEN  <CTRL/E>?   (question  mark).   The following is printed on your
   terminal.

        @ENABLE<RET>
        $^E? one of the following:
           CEASE  CREATE    DEFINE    EDDT      PRINT     QUIT      SEND
           SET    SPEAK

   Characteristics   Characteristics

|       After you type the ^ECEASE command and press RETURN,  the  system
|       outputs  the name of the system to be shutdown (displayed only if
|       the system is part of a DECnet or ARPANET network) and  the  time
|       of the scheduled shutdown.  For example:
|  
|            BADGER Shutdown scheduled for 4-Apr-84 18:00:00
|  
|       If the output is not what you expected, type CTRL/C to abort  the
|       command.  Otherwise, confirm the command by pressing RETURN.

        When the command is in effect, downtime and uptime, if specified,
|       are  reported to users when they first type CTRL/C or RETURN on a
        terminal.  They receive a message similiar to:

             System shutdown scheduled for 22-Apr-84 18:00:00,
             Up again at 22-Apr-84 20:00:00

        When you issue the command,  you  and  users  already  logged  in
        receive one of the following messages.

        If downtime is more than one hour away, the message  is  similiar
        to:

             [System going down at 2-Apr-84 11:30:00]

        If the downtime is 60 or  fewer  minutes  away,  the  message  is
        similiar to:

             [System going down in 30 minutes at 2-Apr-84 11:30:00]

        When the downtime is one minute away, the message is:

             [SYSTEM GOING DOWN IN ONE MINUTE!!]

        One of the preceding messages is also printed at hourly intervals
        before  downtime  and  30  minutes,  15  minutes,  10  minutes, 5
        minutes, and 1 minute before downtime to indicate how long it  is
        before the actual shutdown.

        After downtime occurs, if an uptime was specified, a message like
        the following is printed.

             [System down, up again at 2-Apr-84 12:00:00]

        When downtime occurs, SHUTDOWN COMPLETE is printed  on  the  CTY.
        All jobs are then logged out, except the CTY, so PTYCON continues
        to run.  Processes under  SYSJOB  continue  to  run,  but  PTYCON
        subjobs  are  logged  out.   Then,  no further LOGINs are allowed
        except from the CTY.

        To cancel an existing plan for a shutdown, type ^ECEASE and press
        RETURN.  Then you and all users receive the message:

             [Shutdown cancelled]

        If you do not know the uptime, omit it by pressing  RETURN  after
        (RESUMING AT).  The message output to users before they log in is
        similiar to:

             System shutdown scheduled for 2-Apr-84 16:30:00

        The uptime is  only  informational;  it  does  not  initiate  any
        automatic  startup.  To resume timesharing, you should use ^ESEND
        to say that the system is being reloaded, enter the  PARSER  with
        CTRL/\, type SHUTDOWN, and reload via a load switch.


   Hints   Hints

        After giving the command, look at the output message to check the
        dates  and  times.  The output times are based on a 24-hour clock
        for example, twelve is  added  to  the  hours  between  noon  and
        midnight.  The times are given as hh:mm:ss, where hh is the hour,
        mm is the minute, and ss is the second.

        If you use AM or PM in the time, do not put a space before either
        of  them.  For example, 6:00 PM causes the error message "INVALID
        DATE FORMAT" explained in the Restrictions  section  below.   You
        must use 6:00PM.

        For the time, you must specify minutes if you are also specifying
        hours,  for  example, for 6p.m.  you must use 6:00PM or 1800.  If
        you use 6PM, it is interpreted as 12:06p.m..

        If you give the command with an incorrect date  or  time,  retype
        the command correctly.

        ?Downtime has already passed

             The time you specified for downtime has already gone by.

        ?Downtime cannot be more than 7 days in the future

             You specified a downtime that was too far in the future.

        ?Invalid date format

             You typed an unacceptable date or you typed a  space  before
             AM  or  PM,  which  causes  the  time  specified  not  to be
             recognized as time format.

        ?Invalid time format

             You typed an unacceptable time.

        ?Timesharing will resume before it ends

             You typed an uptime that comes before the downtime.

        structure:         specifies the 1- to  6-character  alphanumeric
                           name  or  logical  name  for  the structure on
                           which you want to create or alter a directory.
                           You  must  type  a  colon  (:) after the name.
                           Also, you must MOUNT the structure using  this
                           name,  unless  the  structure  is  the  public
                           structure   or   an   unregulated   structure.
                           (Regulated   and  unregulated  structures  are
                           discussed in Chapter 2, in the  SET  STRUCTURE

                           default to the public structure.  Note that  a
                           user  must  have  a  directory  on  the public
                           structure to be able to log in.

|       <directory>        specifies the name of the directory  that  you
|                          want  to create or alter.  The name is 1 to 39
|                          alphanumeric  characters,  including  hyphens,
|                          underlines, and dollar signs.  Angle or square
                           brackets must enclose the name.  This name  is
                           used  when  a  user  tries  to  log  in to the
                           system,  connect  to  a  directory,  access  a
                           directory,  or  change  directory  parameters.
                           You can use recognition on this  name  if  the
                           directory already exists.

        password           specifies 1 to 39 letters, digits, or hyphens.
                           You  can omit the password here and specify it
                           later in  a  subcommand.   You  can  omit  the
                           password    completely    for   a   files-only
                           directory.  The password is used when  a  user
                           tries  to  log  in to the system, connect to a
                           directory,  access  a  directory,  or   change
                           directory parameters.

   Characteristics   Characteristics

        To create a directory on a structure, the directory name  in  the
        ^ECREATE  command  must  be different from any existing directory
        name on the structure and must be enclosed in angle brackets.  If
        the  directory name contains one or more periods (.), for example
        <T.YOW>, the directory is a subdirectory.  Before you can  create
        a  subdirectory, you must first create its superior directory, in
        this case <T>.  You can determine the superior  directory  for  a
        subdirectory   by   using   the  name  of  the  subdirectory  and
        eliminating the last period (.) and the characters after it.  For
        example,  the  superior  directory for <FP.BONS> is <FP>, and the
        superior directory for <R.ACE.LT.MEM> is <R.ACE.LT>.

        After you type the ^ECREATE command using either format and press
        RETURN, the system outputs [NEW] or [OLD] on the next line and $$
        on the following line.  Be sure you check this output.  If  [NEW]
        is  printed,  you are creating a directory.  If [OLD] is printed,
        you are altering an existing directory.  If  the  output  is  not
        what  you  expected,  type  ABORT<RET>  and  retype  the ^ECREATE
        command.  The $$ (double-dollar-signs)  indicates  that  you  can
        give  a  subcommand  or  press RETURN to finish the command.  The
        ^ECREATE subcommands are  described  under  Subcommands  in  this
        section.

        If  you  are  creating  a  directory  and  you  press  RETURN  at
        subcommand  level  without  giving  any subcommands, you create a
        directory with default parameters.   (Refer  to  the  Subcommands


                                    3-9
                           ^E PRIVILEGED COMMANDS                           ^E PRIVILEGED COMMANDS


        Table 3-1 in this section for the default parameters.)

        For example, using recognition input,

             $^ECREATE (DIRECTORY NAME) <TES><RET>
             [New]
             $$<RET>
             $

        or simply

             $^ECREATE <TES><RET>
             [New]
             $$<RET>
             $

        If you use the second format of the ^ECREATE command (see  Format
        section  below),  to  create  a directory and you press RETURN at
        subcommand level without giving any  subcommands,  you  create  a
        directory with default parameters except for the password.

        For example,

             $^ECREATE (DIRECTORY NAME) <TES> (PASSWORD) XAP<RET>
             [New]
             $$<RET>
             $

        or simply

             $^ECREATE <TES> XAP<RET>
             [New]
             $$<RET>
             $

        To change the password for an existing  directory,  you  can  use
        either ^ECREATE command format.  However, one format requires the
        PASSWORD subcommand.  For example,

             $^ECREATE SQM:<HOGAN> (PASSWORD) JOHNQ<RET>
             [Old]
             $$<RET>
             $

        or

             $^ECREATE SQM:<HOGAN><RET>
             [Old]
             $$PASSWORD JOHNQ<RET>
             $$<RET>
             $

   Subcommand Characteristics   Subcommand Characteristics

        When you give a subcommand, you need to type only  the  beginning
        characters  up  to the point that the abbreviation is unique.  If
        you want to see the guide words, press the ESCape key  after  you
        give  the  subcommand  or its abbreviation.  You can also see the
        help text for the argument by typing  a  ?   (question  mark)  in
        place  of  the  argument.   After  the  help text is printed, the
        subcommand is repeated up to the argument.  At any  point  before
        you  end  the  subcommand,  you can delete the subcommand line by
        typing CTRL/U.

        To end the subcommand, press  RETURN  or  LINE  FEED.   When  you
        finish  giving subcommands to alter, kill, or create a directory,
        you must type an extra RETURN or LINE FEED for confirmation.

        For the system to ignore the  creation  of  a  directory  or  any
        changes  to  an  old  directory  since  the last ^ECREATE, type a
        CTRL/C any time during the ^ECREATE, or type ABORT at  subcommand
        level, instead or waiting to give the final RETURN or LINE FEED.

                                    NOTE

           Remember that you need to use a subcommand only if you
           want  to  assign  a  nondefault  value  when  you  are
           creating a directory or if  you  want  to  change  any
           value  for an existing directory.  See the Subcommands
           Table for a list of  all  the  subcommands  and  their
           defaults.   You  can  also  print the defaults on your
           terminal by giving the  LIST  subcommand  to  ^ECREATE
           before  you  specify any other subcommands (or you can
           use  the  INFORMATION  DIRECTORY  command  at  TOPS-20
           command level).

           If you change a directory parameter  for  a  logged-in


                                    3-13

           user  and  the  user complains that the change has not
           occurred, tell the user to log out and log  in  again.
           Some  directory  parameters do not take effect until a
           user logs in.


        The  ^ECREATE  subcommands  and  their  guide  words,  functions,
        arguments,  and  defaults  are given on the following pages.  The
        discussion of a subcommand also contains the explanation  of  any
        corresponding negative function.


        ABORT        ABORT

             This  subcommand  returns  you  to  system   command   level
             immediately.   It is equivalent to typing CTRL/C at any time
             before you give the final <RET> to the ^ECREATE command.  As
             a  result, the system ignores the creation of a directory or
             any changes to an old  directory  since  the  last  ^ECREATE
             command was given.

                                 ----- Example -----

             If you give an incorrect name, you can simply abort and type
             ^ECREATE again with the correct name.

             $^ECREATE (DIRECTORY NAME) <TESTING><RET>
             [New]
             $$ABORT<RET>
             $^ECREATE (DIRECTORY NAME) FORT:<TESTING><RET>

             $


        ABSOLUTE-ARPANET-SOCKETS (CAPABILITY)        ABSOLUTE-ARPANET-SOCKETS (CAPABILITY)

             This subcommand grants a user the ABSOLUTE  ARPANET  SOCKETS
             capability.   This  capability  allows  a  user  to  specify
             absolute socket numbers in a certain privileged monitor call
             on a system running TOPS-20AN.

             Give this capability only to those users who need it and who
             can  be  trusted,  because  a  user with this capability can
             break system security.

             NOT  ABSOLUTE-ARPANET-SOCKETS,   which   is   the   default,
             withholds this capability from the user.

                                 ----- Example -----

             To give  a  TOPS-20AN  user  the  ABSOLUTE  ARPANET  SOCKETS

             $


        ACCOUNT-DEFAULT (FOR LOGIN) account        ACCOUNT-DEFAULT (FOR LOGIN) account

             This subcommand specifies  the  default  account  for  users
             logging  into this directory.  A user with a default account
             can press RETURN for the account in the LOGIN  command  when
             logging  into  this  directory, and the account specified in
             this subcommand is used.

             If this subcommand is not given, no default account is  set.
             To eliminate a default account, give this subcommand without
             an  argument.   To  change  a  default  account,  give  this
             subcommand with the new default account as the argument.  At
             some installations,  a  user  can  also  change  an  account
             default with the command SET DIRECTORY ACCOUNT-DEFAULT.

                                   ----- Hint -----

             You  can   also   use   ENABLE   and   the   SET   DIRECTORY
             ACCOUNT-DEFAULT command to change the default account.  When
             you  have  OPERATOR  capability  enabled,  you  can  type  a
             fictitious password in the command.

                                 ----- Example -----

             If  user  J.SMITH  wants   his   default   account   to   be
             PAYROLL.TEST, type the following:

             $^ECREATE <J.SMITH><RET>
             [Old]
             $$ACCOUNT-DEFAULT (FOR LOGIN) PAYROLL.TEST<RET>

        ARCHIVE-ONLINE-EXPIRED-FILES        ARCHIVE-ONLINE-EXPIRED-FILES

             This subcommand specifies that expired disk files are to  be
             automatically  marked for archiving.  The TOPS-20 Operator's
             Guide discusses archiving.

             NOT  ARCHIVE-ONLINE-EXPIRED-FILES,  which  is  the  default,
             causes  all  files  in  the  directory to remain on the disk
             regardless of the expiration date.

                                 ----- Example -----

             To ensure that user GORE's  files  are  archived  some  time
             after  the  expiration  date  is reached, give the following
             command:

             $^ECREATE <GORE><RET>

        ARPANET-ACCESS (CAPABILITY)        ARPANET-ACCESS (CAPABILITY)

             This subcommand, in conjunction with pre-established  system
             manager  controls, grants a user the capability to establish
             ARPANET network connections.  Note that this is the  default
             in the absence of system manager controls.

             NOT ARPANET-ACCESS denies access to the  network.   This  is
             the default if the system manager has exercised control over
             network access.

                                 ----- Example -----

             To enable access to the ARPANET network, type the following:

             $^ECREATE <SIMMONS><RET>
             [Old]
             $$ARPANET-ACCESS (CAPABILITY)<RET>

             $


        ARPANET-WIZARD (CAPABILITY)        ARPANET-WIZARD (CAPABILITY)

             This subcommand grants a user the ARPANET WIZARD capability.
             This  capability allows a user to execute certain privileged
             monitor calls on a system running TOPS-20AN.

             Give this capability only to those users who need it and who
             can  be  trusted,  because  a  user with this capability can
             break system security.

             NOT ARPANET-WIZARD, which is  the  default,  withholds  this
             capability from the user.

                                 ----- Example -----

             To give a TOPS-20AN user the ARPANET WIZARD capability:

        CONFIDENTIAL (INFORMATION ACCESS CAPABILITY)        CONFIDENTIAL (INFORMATION ACCESS CAPABILITY)

             This subcommand grants a user the  confidential  information
             access  capability.  This capability lets a user obtain some
             confidential  information  within  the  system  via  certain
             monitor calls.

             Give this capability only to those users who need it and who
             can  be  trusted,  because  a  user with this capability can
             break system security.

             NOT CONFIDENTIAL,  which  is  the  default,  withholds  this
             capability from the user.

                                 ----- Example -----

             If you need to give  a  user  the  confidential  information
             access capability, give the CONFIDENTIAL subcommand.

             This subcommand, in conjunction with pre-established  system
             manager  controls, grants a user the capability to establish
             DECNET network connections.  Note that this is  the  default
             in the absence of system manager controls.

             NOT DECNET-ACCESS denies access to the network.  This is the
             default  if  the  system  manager has exercised control over
             network access.

                                 ----- Example -----

             To enable access to the DECNET network, type the following:

        DEFAULT-FILE-PROTECTION (NUMBER) 6-digit octal number        DEFAULT-FILE-PROTECTION (NUMBER) 6-digit octal number

             This subcommand specifies the default file-access protection
             for   files   within  this  directory.   (You  can  find  an
             explanation of file-access protection in the TOPS-20  User's
             Guide.)  The  argument  for  this command is a 6-digit octal
             number.  If you do not  use  this  subcommand,  the  default
             protection is 777700.

             To change  the  default  file  protection  for  an  existing
             directory,  give this subcommand with the new protection.  A
             user can also change  this  default  with  the  command  SET
             DIRECTORY FILE-PROTECTION-DEFAULT.

             Do not  confuse  this  value  with  the  protection  of  the
             directory,  which  is set with the PROTECTION (OF DIRECTORY)
             subcommand.

                                   ----- Hint -----

             You  can   also   use   ENABLE   and   the   SET   DIRECTORY
             FILE-PROTECTION-DEFAULT  command  to change the default file
             protection.  When you have OPERATOR capability enabled,  you
             can type a fictitious password in the command.

                                 ----- Example -----

             To make the default file protection 775252 for user TES:

        DIRECTORY-GROUP (NUMBER) decimal group number        DIRECTORY-GROUP (NUMBER) decimal group number

             This subcommand specifies a group number  for  a  directory.
             If  the group number is n, users in group n have group-level
|            access to this directory.  (See the subcommand USER-OF-GROUP
             to  put  a  user  into  a  group.) The group-level access is
             determined by the  directory-  and  file-access  protection.
             (Refer  to  the  TOPS-20  User's Guide for an explanation of
             access protection.)

             The argument is a decimal number from 1 to 262143 (2**18-1).
             Because  you  can  specify only one number for the argument,
             you must repeat  the  subcommand  for  each  group  that  is

             directory.

             NOT DIRECTORY prevents the directory from being accessed  at
             the group level by users in that group.  Because a directory
             does not belong to any group by default,  NOT  DIRECTORY  is
             needed  to  prohibit group access only if DIRECTORY had been
             given for that group.  You must repeat  the  subcommand  for
             each group for which you want access prohibited.

                                 ----- Examples -----

             1.  To make a directory accessible to groups 4 and 9:

                 $^ECREATE <WHITE><RET>
                 [New]
                 $$DIRECTORY-GROUP (NUMBER) 4<RET>
                 $$DIRECTORY-GROUP (NUMBER) 9<RET>
                 $$<RET>
                 $

             2.  If you want to create a directory of library subroutines
                 called  <LIBRARY>, which is accessible to users in group
                 6, give the  subcommand  DIRECTORY  6  when  you  create
                 <LIBRARY>.

                 $^ECREATE <LIBRARY><RET>
                 [New]
                 $$DIRECTORY-GROUP (NUMBER) 6<RET>
                 $$<RET>
                 $

                 Then, to allow a user to access  the  library,  put  the
                 user in user group 6 (see USER subcommand).

                 $^ECREATE (NAME) <ROSEN><RET>
                 [Old]
                 $$USER-GROUP (NUMBER) 6<RET>
                 $$<RET>
                 $



        DISABLE (CAPABILITIES)        DISABLE (CAPABILITIES)

             This subcommand disables any capabilities that you may  have
             activated  with  the ENABLE subcommand or the ENABLE TOPS-20
             command.

             This  subcommand  allows  you  to  activate  any  privileged
             capabilities  that the system manager has given you and that
             you may need during  the  ^ECREATE  session.   This  is  the
             default setting.


        ENQ-DEQ (CAPABILITY)        ENQ-DEQ (CAPABILITY)

             This subcommand gives a  user  the  ability  to  do  certain
             ENQUEUE and DEQUEUE functions.

             Give this capability only to those users who need it and who
             can  be  trusted,  because  a  user with this capability can
             break system security.

             NOT ENQ-DEQ, which is the default,  withholds  this  ability
             from a user.

                                 ----- Example -----

             $^ECREATE <UPDATE><RET>
             [New]
             $$ENQ-DEQ<RET>
             $$<RET>
             $


        FILES-ONLY        FILES-ONLY

             This subcommand makes the directory simply a  storage  place
|            for  files.  A user cannot give the LOGIN or ACCESS commands
|            for this directory.  A user can  gain  owner  privileges  to
|            this   directory   by   giving  the  CONNECT  command.   The
|            subdirectories of a FILES-ONLY directory must be FILES-ONLY.
|            A FILES-ONLY directory cannot receive mail.

|            NOT FILES-ONLY, which is the default, allows a user to  give
|            the LOGIN and ACCESS commands for the directory.

             If  a  FILES-ONLY  directory  does  not  have  a   password,
             connecting  to  it  depends on directory protection and user
             groups.

                                   ----- Hint -----

             To temporarily disable a user from logging in and leave  his
             files  intact,  simply make his directory FILES-ONLY.  Then,
             to restore his log-in  privilege,  make  his  directory  NOT
             FILES-ONLY.   This  method  does not change any of the other
             directory parameters.

                                 ----- Example -----


                                    3-20

             To  make  the  directory   <LIBRARY>   on   structure   FORT
             FILES-ONLY:

             [New]

        GENERATIONS (TO KEEP) decimal number        GENERATIONS (TO KEEP) decimal number

             This specifies the default number of generations that a file
             can  have in this directory.  The argument must be a decimal
             number from 0 to 63, where 0 means an infinite number.   The
             default  is  1.   Currently,  it  is  advisable  to use this
             default to limit disk usage.

             To change  the  number  of  default  generations,  use  this
             subcommand and specify a new number.  At some installations,
             a user can also change this default  with  the  command  SET
             DIRECTORY GENERATION-RETENTION-COUNT-DEFAULT.

                                   ----- Hint -----

             You  can   also   use   ENABLE   and   the   SET   DIRECTORY
             GENERATION-RETENTION-COUNT-DEFAULT  command  to  change  the
             default number  of  generations  to  keep.   When  you  have
             OPERATOR  capability  enabled,  you  can  type  a fictitious
             password in the command.

                                 ----- Example -----

             To allow a user two generations of a file by default:

             $^ECREATE (DIRECTORY NAME) <TRESS><RET>
             [New]
             $$GENERATIONS (TO KEEP) 2<RET>

        IPCF (CAPABILITY)        IPCF (CAPABILITY)

             This subcommand grants a user the  capability  of  executing
             all privileged IPCF functions.

             Give this capability only to those users who need it and who
             can  be  trusted,  because  a  user with this capability can
             break system security.

             NOT IPCF, which is the default,  withholds  this  capability

             from the user.

                                 ----- Example -----

        KILL (THIS DIRECTORY)        KILL (THIS DIRECTORY)

             This subcommand allows you to eliminate a directory from the
             system.   After  you  give  the subcommand, you are asked to
             [CONFIRM].  [CONFIRM] warns you that KILL also  deletes  all
             the  files  in the directory.  At this time be sure that you
             typed the correct directory.  If you did not, type CTRL/C to
             abort immediately.  If it is the right directory, you should
             press RETURN after [CONFIRM].  When  you  get  the  next  $$
             (double-dollar-signs),  you  can  decide  either to continue
             with the KILL by pressing RETURN again or to cancel the KILL
             by typing NOT KILL.

             NOT KILL, which is the default, cancels a KILL subcommand if
             it is given before the ^ECREATE command is completed.

                                  ----- Hints -----

             Do not kill a directory  that  is  logged  in,  because  the
             system  is  not  able  to  use  that user's job number until
             TOPS-20 is reloaded.  If you must kill that  directory,  log
             out the user first and then kill the directory.

             When you kill a directory, you lose all  the  files  in  the
             directory.

             If you try to kill a directory and get:

                  ?Directory file is mapped

             the directory is being used.  You cannot kill the  directory
             until it is not in use.

             If you try to kill a directory and get:



                                    3-22

                  ?Internal format of directory is incorrect

             refer to Part VI, Chapter 1, to delete the directory.

                                 ----- Examples -----

             1.  To eliminate the user ALPHONSE from the system:

                 $^ECREATE PS:<ALPHONSE><RET>
                 [Old]
                 $$KILL<RET>
                 [Confirm]<RET>
                 $$<RET>
                 $


             2.  To prevent killing a directory when  you  discover  that
                 you typed the wrong name:

                 $^ECREATE <ROSENBURG><RET>
                 [Old]
                 $$KILL<RET>
                 [CONFIRM]^C
                           !
                        <CTRL/C>
                 $



        LIST argument        LIST argument

             This subcommand lets you  check  the  directory  parameters.
             Consequently,  it  helps  to use it before you terminate the
             ^ECREATE command, so you can make any necessary changes.

             The acceptable arguments are FAST, NAME-ONLY,  and  VERBOSE.
             If no argument is typed, FAST is assumed.

                                ----- Arguments -----

             If you type LIST FAST or LIST<RET>, the output  is  a  short
             list  equivalent  to  the  output  from the ^EPRINT command.
             Items not listed have default values.

             If you type LIST NAME-ONLY, the output gives the name of the
             directory  that  you  specified  after the ^ECREATE command.
             This is equivalent to the output from  the  ^EPRINT  command
             with the NAME-ONLY subcommand.

             If  you  type  LIST  VERBOSE,  the  output  lists  all   the
|            parameters  except  PASSWORD,  NOT ABSOLUTE-ARPANET-SOCKETS,
             and NOT ARPANET-WIZARD.  This is equivalent  to  the  output


                                    3-23
                           ^E PRIVILEGED COMMANDS                           ^E PRIVILEGED COMMANDS


             from  the  ^EPRINT  command  with  the  VERBOSE  subcommand,
             providing the directory was previously completed.

                                   ----- Hint -----

             If you typed KILL as a subcommand, the LIST output is simply
             KILLED.  For example,

                  $$KILL<RET>
                  [Confirm]<RET>
                  $$LIST<RET>
                   Killed
                  $$

        MAINTENANCE (CAPABILITY)        MAINTENANCE (CAPABILITY)

             This subcommand grants a user  the  MAINTENANCE  capability.
             It  allows  the  user  to execute certain system maintenance
             functions.

             Give this capability only to those users who need it and who
             can  be  trusted,  because  a  user with this capability can
             break system security.

             NOT  MAINTENANCE,  which  is  the  default,  withholds  this
             capability from the user.

                                 ----- Example -----

             To  give  the  field  service  directory   the   MAINTENANCE

        MAXIMUM-SUBDIRECTORIES (ALLOWED) decimal number        MAXIMUM-SUBDIRECTORIES (ALLOWED) decimal number

             This subcommand specifies a limit for the sum of the  number
             of  subdirectories  that can be created in the directory and
             the number of subdirectories that can currently be delegated
             to subdirectories in the directory.  The limit can be from 0
             to 262143.

             A number of subdirectories is delegated when the  value  for
             MAXIMUM-SUBDIRECTORIES  is  specified  for a subdirectory in
             the directory.   After  subdirectories  are  delegated,  the
             value  for  MAXIMUM-SUBDIRECTORIES in the superior directory
             is automatically decremented by the number delegated.

             The default value is zero.  You can  change  the  value  for
             this parameter by giving the subcommand with a new value.

                                 ----- Example -----

             To let user WIZARD create two subdirectories and allow those

             The function for NOT  subcommand  is  discussed  under  each
             subcommand,  for  example, NOT USER-GROUP is described under
             the subcommand USER-GROUP.

                                 ----- Examples -----

             1.  To take away the ENQ-DEQ capability from JONES:

                 $^ECREATE <JONES><RET>
                 [Old]
                 $$NOT ENQ-DEQ<RET>

                 $DISABLE<RET>
                 @

             2.  To prohibit the directory <GAMES> on structure FUN  from
                 being  accessed  by  users in group 9 when the directory
                 protection does not allow all users to access <GAMES>:

                 $^ECREATE FUN:<GAMES><RET>

        NUMBER (OF DIRECTORY) octal directory number        NUMBER (OF DIRECTORY) octal directory number

             This subcommand allows you to  assign  an  unused  directory
             number  to  the directory that you are creating.  The number
             must be octal.  Certain programs use  a  specific  directory
             number.   Also,  directory numbers 1 through 17 are reserved
             for use by DIGITAL.  Currently, <ROOT-DIRECTORY>,  <SYSTEM>,
             <SUBSYS>,  <ACCOUNTS>,  <OPERATOR>,  and  <SPOOL>  must have
             directory numbers 1 to 6, respectively.

             If you do not use  this  subcommand,  a  default  number  is
             chosen by TOPS-20.  You should always use the default number
             unless the directory must have a specific number.

             While creating a new directory, you can change  a  directory
             number  you specified by repeating the subcommand with a new
             number or by giving the  subcommand  NUMBER  0  to  get  the
             default.  However, once you create the directory, you cannot
             change this number.

                                 ----- Example -----



                                    3-27

             To re-create  the  directory  <OPERATOR>,  which  must  have
             directory number 5:

             $^ECREATE <OPERATOR><RET>
             [New]

        OFFLINE-EXPIRATION-DEFAULT (IS)        OFFLINE-EXPIRATION-DEFAULT (IS) date or +n

             This subcommand establishes the  tape  expiration  date  for
             files  in  your directory that are to go off line because of
             migration or archiving.  To generate a relative  date,  give
             the  "+n"  argument,  where  n represents the number of days
             from the removal date.

             After issuing this subcommand, you  may  receive  the  error
             message:

                  ?Offline expiration time cannot exceed system maximum.

             In this situation, you have requested a longer  interval  of
             time than that established by the system manager.  Issue the
             INFORMATION (ABOUT) SYSTEM-STATUS command to learn what  the
             system  default  is.   (Refer to the description of the PUSH
             subcommand, below, for information on entering  and  exiting
             from TOPS-20 command level during the ^ECREATE session.)

                                 ----- Example -----

             To indicate that all off-line files  can  be  expunged  from
             tape  two  months after the removal date, give the following
             command:

             $^ECREATE <ANDERSON><RET>
             [New]
             $$OFFLINE-EXPIRATION-DEFAULT (IS) +60<RET>
             $$<RET>
             $


        ONLINE-EXPIRATION-DEFAULT (IS)        ONLINE-EXPIRATION-DEFAULT (IS) date or +n

             This subcommand establishes the  expiration  date  for  disk
             files  that  are  to  be  created  in  the  directory.  Upon
             expiration, the  files  will  be  automatically  marked  for
             archiving     if     you     previously     specified    the
             ARCHIVE-ONLINE-EXPIRED-FILES  subcommand.   To  indicate   a
             relative  date,  give  the "+n" argument, where n represents
             the number of days from the creation date.

                                 ----- Example -----

             If user HILL wants all newly  created  files  to  expire  on
             Labor Day, issue the following:

             $^ECREATE (DIRECTORY NAME) <HILL><RET>

        OPERATOR (CAPABILITY)        OPERATOR (CAPABILITY)

             This subcommand  grants  a  user  the  OPERATOR  capability.
             Normally,   it   is   given   to  the  operator's  directory
             <OPERATOR>.

             NOT OPERATOR, which is the default, withholds the capability
             from a user.

                                 ----- Example -----

             To give <2-OPERATOR> the OPERATOR capability:

             $^ECREATE <2-OPERATOR><RET>
             [New]
             $$OPERATOR<RET>
             $$<RET>

        PASSWORD 1 to 39 alphanumeric characters or hyphens        PASSWORD 1 to 39 alphanumeric characters or hyphens

             This subcommand specifies the password for the directory.  A
             user must give his correct password to log in to the system.
             The identifier may be 1 to 39 letters, digits, or hyphens.

             If this subcommand is not given  and  the  password  is  not
             specified  on the same line as ^ECREATE, no password is set.
             To eliminate a password, give  this  subcommand  without  an
             argument.

             You  can  change  an  existing  password  by   giving   this
             subcommand  with the new password.  At some installations, a
             user can  also  change  a  password  with  the  command  SET
             DIRECTORY PASSWORD.

                                   ----- Hint -----

|            change the password with the SET DIRECTORY PASSWORD command.
|            This method  has  the  advantage  of  not  echoing  the  new

                                 ----- Examples -----

             1.  To change a user's password to NEW-ONE:

        PERMANENT (DISK STORAGE PAGE LIMIT) argument*       PERMANENT (DISK STORAGE PAGE LIMIT) argument
*  
*            This subcommand specifies the limit of the sum of disk space
*            that  the  directory  can have for permanent storage and the
*            disk space that can be delegated to  subdirectories  in  the
*            directory for permanent storage.
*  
*            Disk space for permanent storage is delegated when the value
*            for  PERMANENT  is  specified  for  a  subdirectory  in  the
*            directory.  After permanent storage is delegated, the  value
*            for  PERMANENT  in  the  superior directory is automatically
*            decremented by the amount delegated.
*  
*            You should make permanent storage  less  than  or  equal  to
*            working   storage.   You  can  change  the  value  for  this
*            parameter by giving the subcommand with a new value.
*  
*            The arguments are the number of pages or INFINITY.
*  
*                               ----- Arguments -----
*  
*            The number of pages argument is a  decimal  number  where  a
*            page is 512 36-bit words.  The default value is 250 pages.
*  
*            The INFINITY argument allocates an unlimited number of pages
*            to  the  directory.   The  permanent storage of the superior

*            directory must also be INFINITY.  The number of  pages  that
*            can  be  used  by  the user is limited to the number of free
*            pages on the  structure.   This  argument  is  intended  for

|            This  subcommand  preserves  the  values  of  the   superior
|            directory's  PERMANENT,  WORKING  and MAXIMUM-SUBDIRECTORIES
|            parameters.  Normally, when you create a  subdirectory,  the
|            PERMANENT,  WORKING,  and MAXIMUM-SUBDIRECTORIES subcommands
|            subtract equal values from the permanent superior directory.
|            The  PRESERVE  subcommand,  when  used  with  the PERMANENT,

             This  subcommand  specifies  the  access  protection  for  a
             directory.  (You can find an explanation of directory-access
                               _______ ______ _____             protection in the TOPS-20 User's Guide.)  The  argument  for
             this  command  is a 6-digit octal number.  If you do not use
             this subcommand, the directory protection is 777700.

             To change the protection of an existing directory, give this
             subcommand  with the new protection.  A user can also change
             the protection of a directory with the command SET DIRECTORY
             PROTECTION.

                                   ----- Hint -----

             You can also use ENABLE and  the  SET  DIRECTORY  PROTECTION
             command  to  change  the protection.  When you have OPERATOR
             capability enabled, you can type a  fictitious  password  in
             the command.

                                 ----- Example -----

             To  make  the  <LIBRARY>  directory  protection  775252   on

        PUSH (COMMAND LEVEL)        PUSH (COMMAND LEVEL)

             This subcommand creates a level of TOPS-20 inferior  to  the
             one  from  which you issued the ^ECREATE command, and leaves
             your terminal at this new level.  You can issue any  TOPS-20
             command  from this level.  Give the POP command to return to
             your ^ECREATE session.

             With this subcommand you  can  leave  the  ^ECREATE  command
             sequence  in  order  to  issue  a user, operator, or another
             privileged command, as the need arises.  Following this, you
             can  resume  ^ECREATE  activities,  with  your previous work
             intact.

|            You can use the PUSH subcommand to create an  inferior  EXEC
|            of  your choice.  Normally, PUSH creates the EXEC defined by
|            the system logical name  DEFAULT-EXEC:.   You  can  use  the
|            DEFINE  command  to define a job definition of DEFAULT-EXEC:

             for a subdirectory in this directory.

             The argument is a decimal number from 1 to 262143 (2**18-1).
|            You  can  specify a maximum of 40 different groups.  Because
             you can give only one number for the argument, however,  you
             must  repeat  the  subcommand  for each different group.  If
             this subcommand is being specified for a  subdirectory,  the
             user-group  number  must be in the list of subdirectory user
             groups allowed in the superior directory.

             NOT SUBDIRECTORY-USER-GROUP removes a group from the list of
             groups  allowed.   To  remove  more  than one group from the
             list, you must repeat the subcommand for each group.

             with the same directory group number.  (See  the  subcommand
             DIRECTORY-GROUP to specify a directory group number.)

             The argument is a decimal number from 1 to 262143 (2**18-1).
|            A  user  can  belong  to  a  maximum of 40 different groups.
|            However, because you  can  give  only  one  number  for  the
             argument,  you must repeat the subcommand for each different
             group.   If  this  subcommand  is  being  specified  for   a
             subdirectory,  the  user group number must be in the list of
             subdirectory user groups allowed in the superior directory.

|            NOT USER-OF-GROUP removes  a  user  from  the  group  number
             specified.   To  remove a user from more than one group, you
             must repeat the subcommand for each group.

                                 ----- Examples -----

             1.  To put a user in groups 3, 9, and 27:

                 Be  very  cautious  about  giving  this  capability,
                 because  it  allows  a  user  to  do anything on the
                 system and possibly destroy system security.

             NOT WHEEL, which is the default, withholds  this  capability
             from a user.

*            After temporary working space is delegated,  the  value  for

*  
*            The number of pages argument is a  decimal  number  where  a
*            page is 512 36-bit words.  The default value is 250 pages.
*  
*            The INFINITY argument allocates an unlimited number of pages
*            to  the  directory.   The  working  storage  of the superior
*            directory must also be INFINITY.  The number of  pages  that
*            can  be  used  by  the user is limited to the number of free
*            pages on the  structure.   This  argument  is  intended  for
*            special  system  directories; it is not intended for general
*            users.

        MAXIMUM-SUBDIRECTORIES  that  exceeds  what  is  allowed  by  the
        superior directory.

   ?Request exceeds superior directory working quota.

        The number of pages you specified for  a  subdirectory's  working
        disk-storage  page  limit  exceeds  the working disk-storage page
        limit remaining for the superior directory.

   ?Structure str: not mounted

        The structure you specified, str:, has not been mounted.  Be sure
        you  typed the structure name correctly.  Also, MOUNT a structure
        before you create a directory on it.

   ?Subdirectory quota insufficient for existing subdirectories.

        You tried to specify a value for MAXIMUM-SUBDIRECTORIES  that  is
        less  than  the  number  of  subdirectories  already  created and
        delegated.

   ?Superior directory does not exist.

        You  tried  to  create  the  subdirectory  <directory.xxx>,   but
        <directory>, the superior directory, does not exist.

   ?Superior directory full

        Either <ROOT-DIRECTORY> on the structure where you are trying  to
        create  a  directory  cannot contain any more directories, or you
        are trying  to  create  <directory.xxx>  and  <directory>  cannot
        contain any more directories.

        ?Working space insufficient for current allocation.

             You tried to specify a value for WORKING that is  less  than
             the  current disk space already being used by the directory.
             Refer to Example 2 of the PUSH  subcommand  description  for
             help.

        ?You can't change the number of an old directory

             You cannot change the number of an existing directory.

   ^EDEFINE - DEFINING AND DELETING SYSTEM LOGICAL NAMES   ^EDEFINE - DEFINING AND DELETING SYSTEM LOGICAL NAMES


   Function   Function

        The ^EDEFINE command creates or deletes system logical names.   A
        system logical name applies to all users on the system.  A system
        logical name is a list  of  system  directories  that  tells  the
        system  where  and  in  what  order  to search for a file for all
        users.

        ^EDEFINE (SYSTEM LOGICAL NAME) lognam: (AS) filespec


   Arguments   Arguments

        lognam:            specifies a 1-  to  39-character  alphanumeric
                           abbreviation  or  system  logical  name  to be
                           defined or deleted, or * to delete all  system
                           logical names.

        filespec           specifies  one  or  more  file  specifications
                           separated  by commas.  A file specification is
                           any combination of device or  structure  name,
                           directory    name,    filename,   file   type,
                           generation number, and wild cards.  If you are
                           deleting  a  system  logical name, do not type
                           any file specification.


   Hints   Hints

        Whenever you give this command, you are asked to CONFIRM.  If you
        have  typed the command correctly, press RETURN.  Otherwise, type
        CTRL/U and retype the command.

        Do not confuse the ^EDEFINE command with the TOPS-20 EXEC  DEFINE
        command.   The DEFINE command defines a logical name for only the
        user that issues the command.   (See  the  TOPS-20  User's  Guide
        and/or  TOPS-20 Commands Manual for a complete description of the
        DEFINE command.)

        To check the current  list  of  system  logical  names,  use  the
        command  INFORMATION  (ABOUT)  LOGICAL  NAMES  with  the argument
        SYSTEM.  You should use this command before and after you add  or
        delete a system logical name.  For example:

             @INFORMATION (ABOUT) LOGICAL-NAMES (OF) SYSTEM<RET>
             CR: => CDR:
             DS: => DSK:

        The following is a warning message associated with  the  ^EDEFINE
        command:

        %Logical name lognam:  was not defined

             The system logical name "lognam:" that you tried  to  delete
             was not defined.

        The following are error messages  associated  with  the  ^EDEFINE
        command:

        ?Directory terminating delimiter  is  not  preceded  by  a  valid
             beginning delimiter

             You made an error in typing the file specification.  Perhaps
             you forgot a comma between two directory names.

        ?Invalid character in filename

             You typed an invalid character in the file specification.

        ?More than one name field is not allowed

             You made an error in the file specification.   You  probably
             typed a period instead of a comma.

   Format   Format

        ^EEDDT


   Characteristics   Characteristics

        The ^EEDDT command should be used only by  a  system  programmer.
        If necessary, it gets DDT from the file SYS.UDDT.EXE and stores a
        symbol table pointer into it.  Normally,  this  command  is  used
        only by a system programmer to debug the EXEC.

   Hint   Hint

        If you get into EDDT by mistake, type $G to get back to the EXEC.
        For example,

             @ENABLE<RET>

                           structure   is   assumed.   If  you  have  not
                           connected to a  specific  structure,  you  are
                           connected  by default to the public structure.
                           You cannot use recognition  on  the  structure
                           name.

        <directory>        specifies 1 to 39 letters, digits, hyphens, or
                           periods representing the name of the directory
                           for which you want information.  The directory
                           name  must be embedded in angle brackets.  You

   Hints   Hints

        If you want to see the values of all the parameters,  except  the
        ARPANET  ones, use the VERBOSE subcommand.  Once you are familiar
        with default values, you seldom need to use VERBOSE.

|       You can also use the EXEC command, INFORMATION (ABOUT) DIRECTORY,
|       instead of ^EPRINT.

        If you need to change a parameter, use ^ECREATE.


   Restrictions   Restrictions

        The following are error  messages  associated  with  the  ^EPRINT
        command:

        ?Invalid structure name

             You specified a structure  name  incorrectly.   Perhaps  you
             omitted  the  angle brackets around a directory name, or you
             omitted the colon after the structure name.

        ?No such directory

             The user name that you  typed  does  not  exist.   Type  the
             command again with a valid user name; try recognition input.

   ^EQUIT - HALTING THE EXEC   ^EQUIT - HALTING THE EXEC


   Function   Function

        The ^EQUIT command halts the EXEC (the TOPS-20 command processor)
        and  returns control to the program under which the EXEC is being
        run.

   Format   Format

        ^EQUIT


   Hint   Hint

        The ^EQUIT command should be used only by  a  system  programmer.
        For  the privileged user the command is normally used to get into
        the MINI-EXEC.  The prompt  to  indicate  that  you  are  in  the
        MINI-EXEC is MX>.  Some commands for the MINI-EXEC are documented
        in the TOPS-20 Software  Installation  Guide,  because  they  are
        useful in the installation process.

        If you get into the  MINI-EXEC  by  mistake,  type  S  after  the
        prompt.   TART will be printed immediately.  Press RETURN and you
        are back at EXEC level with the enable prompt.  (See the  example
        below.)

        Once you use ^EQUIT to enter the  MINI-EXEC,  whenever  you  type
        <CTRL/P>  thereafter,  you enter the MINI-EXEC.  The <CTRL/P> has
        this effect until you log out.


   Restriction   Restriction

        You must have WHEEL capability to execute the ^EQUIT command.  If
        you issue the ^EQUIT command without WHEEL capability, a question
        mark appears and the enabled prompt reappears.  For example,

             @ENABLE<RET>
             $^EQUIT<RET>
             ?
             $DISABLE<RET>

   Function   Function

|       immediately to all users or to a particular user on the system.


   Format   Format

*       ^ESEND (TO) user message
*  
*  
   Arguments*  Arguments
*  
*       user               specifies a user name,  terminal-line  number,
                           or an asterisk (*) for all terminals.

|       message            specifies a message of one  to  six  lines  of
|                          text followed by a carriage return.


   Characteristics   Characteristics

|       The ^ESEND command accepts multiple-line messages with up to  six
|       lines  of text.  You can continue typing the message past the end
|       of a line and  onto  the  next  line,  without  pressing  RETURN.
|       ^ESEND  reorganizes  the  message so that any words split between
|       two lines appear on the same line on receiving terminals.
|  
|       If you want to avoid divided words while typing your message, use
|       the hyphen (-) continue character.  At the end of each line, type
|       a space and a hyphen, and then press RETURN.

        The  ^ESEND  command  does  not  send   the   message   to   PTYs
        (pseudo-terminals).   When  you  end  the command, the message is
        then printed on the specified terminals.


   Hints   Hints

        Use the TOPS-20 SYSTAT command to determine a user's line number.

        If you wish to begin the message with a question mark  (?),  type


                                    3-56

        CTRL/V  before  the  "?".   The CTRL/V allows the "?" to be taken
        literally instead of printing the help text.  Note that CTRL/V is
        required only if the "?" is in the first character position.

        1.  To immediately tell all users to free up disk space,  because
            available disk space is getting low:

|       2.  Send a multiple-line message to TTY20:.  Note that the  words
|           "installed" and "converted" are divided between lines.

            converted until tonight.  Please wait until tomorrow to  make
            new entries.<RET>

            The message appears on the receiving terminals as:

            [From OPERATOR on line 17:

|            Sets the system date and time while the system  is  running.
             This  is  helpful if you type an incorrect date or time when
             you start the system.  It is also  useful  when  the  system
             time  has fallen behind because the system has been down for
             a while and then continued.

             (See the examples of legal dates and times under the ^ECEASE
             command.)

|                             ----- Characteristic -----
|  
|            The ^ESET DATE-AND-TIME command, given from any OPR terminal
|            in  a CFS cluster, sets the date and time for all systems in
|            the cluster.

                                   ----- Hint -----

             If  you  set  the  time  back,  you  can  seriously   affect
             accounting and the compilation of user programs.  Therefore,
             you should notify all users that you had  to  set  the  time
             back.

             After you give the  ^ESET  DATE-AND-TIME  command,  you  can
             check  the  results  with the TOPS-20 DAYTIME command or the
             OPR command:  SHOW DAYTIME.

        LOGINS-ALLOWED (ON) terminal        LOGINS-ALLOWED (ON) terminal

|            specifies the terminals from which LOGINs will succeed.  The
|            value of terminal can be:

                  ANY-TERMINAL
                  ARPANET-TERMINALS
                  CONSOLE-TERMINAL

                  PSEUDO-TERMINALS
                  REMOTE-TERMINALS

             The argument  (terminal)  you  give  adds  to  the  list  of
             terminals allowed.  It does not change the list to only what
             you just typed.

             Before SYSJOB.RUN is processed at system startup, LOGINs are
             allowed  from  PSEUDO-TERMINALS  and  the  CONSOLE-TERMINAL.
             After SYSJOB.RUN is processed, LOGINs are allowed  from  any
             terminal.

             To  check  the  current  LOGINS-ALLOWED,  type  the  TOPS-20
             command INFORMATION (ABOUT) SYSTEM-STATUS.

             To disallow certain terminals, use ^ESET NO  LOGINS-ALLOWED,
             described as the next Argument to the ^ESET command.

                                 ----- Examples -----

             1.  If you previously had LOGINs  at  the  console  terminal
                 only and you also want to allow pseudo-terminal LOGINs:

                 @ENABLE<RET>
                 $^ESET LOGINS-ALLOWED (ON) PSEUDO-TERMINALS<RET>
                 $DISABLE<RET>
                 @

             2.  To allow LOGINs from anywhere:

                 @ENABLE<RET>
                 $^ESET LOGINS-ALLOWED (ON) ANY-TERMINAL<RET>
                 $DISABLE<RET>
                 @

        NO LOGINS-ALLOWED (ON) terminal        NO LOGINS-ALLOWED (ON) terminal

             specifies to disallow LOGINs from  certain  terminals.   The
             value terminal can be:

                  ANY-TERMINAL
                  ARPANET-TERMINALS
                  CONSOLE-TERMINAL
|                 DECNET-TERMINALS
                  LOCAL-TERMINALS
                  PSEUDO-TERMINALS
                  REMOTE-TERMINALS

             Thus, you can  prevent  certain  users  from  accessing  the
             system.   The  command  removes the specified terminals from
             the list of terminals from which LOGINs are allowed.

                                 ----- Example -----

             To disallow LOGINs from remote terminals:

                  @ENABLE<RET>

             It  also  notifies  OPR/ORION  that  form  changing  can  be
             performed on the line printers.

                                 ----- Example -----

             When you return after no operator was present, type:

        NO OPERATOR-IN-ATTENDANCE        NO OPERATOR-IN-ATTENDANCE

             specifies there is no operator present on the system.   (The
             INFORMATION  (ABOUT)  SYSTEM-STATUS command displays whether
             or not an operator is in attendance.) This command  prevents
             certain   system   programs,   for   example,  PLEASE,  from
             indefinitely waiting for an operator to  respond.   It  also
             notifies  OPR/ORION  to  not allow any forms changing on the
             line printers.  Be sure to give this command  if  you  leave
             the computer room temporarily or if your shift is ending and
             no operator is coming on duty.

             This is the default setting.

                                 ----- Example -----

             To indicate that  there  is  no  operator  present,  send  a
             message to all users that you are leaving, and then type:

                  @ENABLE<RET>

        PRIVATE-QUASAR (FOR PRIVATE GALAXY)        PRIVATE-QUASAR (FOR PRIVATE GALAXY)

             specifies that the EXEC is to communicate with your  private
             copy  of the Galaxy subsystem, rather than with the system's
             copy.  For example, when you issue such Galaxy-related  EXEC
             commands  as PRINT or SUBMIT, your private copy of QUASAR (a
             major component of the Galaxy subsystem) gets control.


        NO PRIVATE-QUASAR (FOR PRIVATE GALAXY)        NO PRIVATE-QUASAR (FOR PRIVATE GALAXY)

        RUN-TIME-GUARANTEE (FOR JOB) n (TO) m (PERCENT)        RUN-TIME-GUARANTEE (FOR JOB) n (TO) m (PERCENT)

             specifies a guarantee of at least a certain  percentage  (m)
|            of  run-time  to  a  particular  job  (n).  The n is the job
             number and the m is the percentage of runtime from 1 to 100.
             Then,  from  the  time  a  job  wants  to  run,  the TOPS-20
             scheduler tries to give  the  job  at  least  the  specified
             percentage  of  central  processing time, for as long as the
             job continues to run.  Be extremely cautious about giving  a
             job 100 percent, because you may not be able to give another
             command.  Note that this  command  has  no  effect  if  your
             system is running the class scheduler.

                                 ----- Example -----

             To guarantee 5 percent runtime to job 11:

                  @ENABLE<RET>
                  $^ESET RUN-TIME-GUARANTEE (FOR JOB) 11 (TO) 5 (PERCENT)<RET>

             job.

                                 ----- Example -----

             To cancel the runtime guarantee for job 11:

        TERMINAL n m SPEED (OF INPUT) r (OF OUTPUT) t|       TERMINAL n m SPEED (OF INPUT) r (OF OUTPUT) t
|  
|            specifies that terminal (n), or a range of terminals  (n m),
|            where  n  is  the  lowest  terminal line number and m is the
|            highest, have an input speed of r and an output speed of  t;
|            r is the receive baud rate; and t is the transmit baud rate.

|            600, 1200, 1800, 2400, 4800, and 9600.

             This command works like the user command TERMINAL SPEED, but
             it also allows you to set the speeds for any terminal on the
             system.  If you give only one  speed,  it  applies  to  both

        PROCESS COMMANDS        PROCESS COMMANDS

             RUN filespec of program             RUN filespec of program

                  This command creates an inferior process and  runs  the
                  specified  program in it.  The process is identified by
                  a name consisting of the first six  characters  of  the
                  name portion of the file specification.

             KILL name             KILL name

                  This command kills the process of the specified name.

             PURGE process number             PURGE process number

                  This command kills the process of the specified number.
                  Process  numbers  appear  in  the  first  column of the
                  STATUS command display.  With the  PURGE  command,  you
                  can distinguish among processes having the same name.

             FREEZE name             FREEZE name

                  This command  temporarily  suspends  execution  of  the
                  specified  process (name).  This may later be undone by
                  the RESUME command.

             RESUME name             RESUME name

                  This command continues execution of the process  having
                  the  specified  name,  thus  undoing  the  effect  of a
                  previous FREEZE.

             DUMP process number             DUMP process number

                  This command allows you  to  obtain  a  snapshot  of  a
                  process'    memory   without   disturbing   operations.
                  Execution of the process is temporarily suspended;  the
                  ACs  and  memory  contents  are  saved in file xxx.DMP,
                  where xxx  is  the  process  name;  then  execution  is
                  resumed.  Refer to Example 4.


        JOB COMMANDS        JOB COMMANDS

             JOB ident text-string             JOB ident text-string

                  This command transmits text to a job via  a  PTY.   The
                  ident  is an arbitrary small integer not related to the
                  system job number of the  job  being  controlled.   You
                  should  choose  the  smallest number (beginning with 0)
                  not presently  in  use  when  a  new  job  is  desired.
                  Thereafter, that number identifies that job for SYSJOB.

                  The  text-string  is  a  string  of   system   commands
                  surrounded  by  any  character not occurring within the
                  string, for example, /a  string  of  characters/.   The
                  string   may   include   <RET>,  other  format  control
                  characters, and control characters.  You must  indicate
                  a  control character by typing an up-arrow (^) followed
                  by the character.  If you want to indicate an up-arrow,
                  when  it  is  not  being  used  to  indicate  a control
                  character, type two up-arrows.  If there is no  job  in
                  existence  when a JOB command is executed, a ^C is sent
                  ahead of the  specified  text  to  create  one.   Note,
                  however,  that  the job is not automatically logged in,
                  so a LOGIN command must be given via the JOB command.

                  Any output from the job is handled by SYSJOB and  typed
                  on  the  CTY.   Each  line  is  prefixed with the ident
                  number of the job which produced the output.  Output is
                  only  typed  at the end of a line, so prompt characters
                  coming from a job are not seen until the  remainder  of

                  the line has been input.

             KILLJOB ident             KILLJOB ident

                  This command forces a LOGOUT of the specified job.

             CCJOB ident             CCJOB ident

                  This command transmits two ^C's to  the  specified  job
                  and  holds  any  further input until the ^C's have been
                  processed.


        OTHER COMMANDS        OTHER COMMANDS

             STATUS             STATUS

                  This command prints, on the  CTY,  the  status  of  all
                  existing inferior processes and jobs presently known to
                  SYSJOB.

             RELOAD             RELOAD

                  This  command  causes  SYSJOB  to  reload  and  restart
                  itself.  Use this command with great caution, as it can
                  cause an abrupt termination of all  inferior  processes
                  and  detach  any PTY-controlled jobs.  If possible, you
                  should kill all processes and log out all  jobs  before
                  the RELOAD is executed.  This command allows you to put
                  a  new  version  of  SYSJOB   into   operation   during
                  timesharing  and  provides  the possibility of recovery
                  after a severe SYSJOB malfunction.


   Characteristics   Characteristics

        All text on the line following the prompt message up to CTRL/Z is
        input  to  SYSJOB.   Actually,  the text is written into the file
|       SYSTEM:SYSJOB.COMMANDS.  Then, a  wakeup  request  is  issued  to
|       SYSJOB  which  reads  the  file  and performs the commands in it.
        Thus, it is equivalent to:

|            COPY (FROM) TTY: (TO) SYSTEM:SYSJOB.COMMANDS

        as soon as SYSJOB wakes up and reads the file.

        The text must consist of SYSJOB commands, which are described  in
        this  section  under  the Subcommands heading.  The same commands
        are  recognized  in  both  the  SYSJOB.COMMANDS  file   and   the
        SYSJOB.RUN  file,  which  SYSJOB  reads  at  system startup.  The
        commands are in the form  of  a  keyword,  possibly  followed  by
        arguments.  The commands (text) can be divided into three types:


                                    3-68

             1.  Those affecting an inferior process:

                      RUN, KILL, FREEZE, RESUME

             2.  Those  affecting  a  job  being  controlled  by  a   PTY
                 (pseudo-terminal):

                      JOB, KILLJOB, CCJOB

             3.  Others:

                      STATUS, RELOAD


   Hint   Hint

        All SYSJOB output appears on the CTY.  Therefore, if you are at a
        terminal  other  than  the CTY and you want to see SYSJOB output,
        enable for OPERATOR or WHEEL capability,  TALK  to  the  terminal
|       that  is  the  CTY,  give  the ^ESPEAK command followed by SYSJOB
        commands, and type BREAK after you have seen the output.


   Restriction   Restriction

        The following  error  message  is  associated  with  the  ^ESPEAK
        command:

|       ? CAN'T GET JFN ON <SYSTEM>SYSJOB.COMMANDS
|  
|            You have typed ENABLE but you do not have OPERATOR or  WHEEL
|            capability.       Therefore,      you      cannot      write
|            SYSTEM:SYSJOB.COMMANDS.  You should log into an account that
|            has  OPERATOR  capability  (for example, OPERATOR), and then
|            type ENABLE and reissue the ^ESPEAK command.

            The output  above  shows  that  there  is  only  one  process
            currently  known  to  SYSJOB.   To  examine it, give the DUMP
            command, and specify the process number, which appears in the
            leftmost column of the status display:

            $^ESPEAK (TO SYSJOB)<RET>
             [PLEASE TYPE SYSJOB COMMANDS - END WITH ^Z]

            DUMP 0<RET>
            <CTRL/Z>

            Output similar to the following appears on the CTY, providing
            you  with  the  name  of  the  file  that  contains the saved
            process-related information:

            DUMP 0

   4.1  INTRODUCTION TO PTYCON

   Your TOPS-20 operating system considers all  jobs  to  be  timesharing
   jobs;  thus,  each  job must be associated with a timesharing terminal
   (TTY).  In some situations, however, it is inconvenient to  require  a
   timesharing  terminal  to  be associated with every job on the system;
   for example, where many jobs are  needed  for  a  single  application.
   PTYCON  provides  a  method whereby a single job running from a single
   timesharing terminal can control many subjobs simultaneously.  This is
   accomplished by implementing a "device" called a pseudo-terminal (PTY)
   that, in  effect,  is  a  software  simulation  of  a  terminal.   The
   controlling  job,  PTYCON,  can  send information to a PTY and receive
   information from a PTY.

   PTYCON  starts  running  subjobs  by  means  of  pseudo-terminals  and
   controls  each subjob by sending appropriate information (for example,
   the commands and/or data you give it) over  the  PTY  controlling  the
   subjob.   You can run as many subjobs as there are PTYs on the system,
   up to a maximum of 24.  PTYCON allows you to remain  at  one  terminal
   and still control multiple jobs over multiple PTYs.



   4.2  STARTING PTYCON

|  PTYCON is normally started automatically by  SYSJOB  on  your  console
|  terminal  (CTY)  when  the system is brought up.  At this time, PTYCON
   reads and processes the file <SYSTEM>PTYCON.ATO (usually  referred  to
   as   an   "Auto-File").   This  file  contains  commands  for  PTYCON.
   Following is example of a <SYSTEM>PTYCON.ATO  file  that  defines  and
   starts the subjobs OPR, CHECKD, and FILCOM:

        SILENCE
        LOG
        DEFINE 0 OPR
        OPR-LOG OPERATOR FOO OPERATOR
        DEFINE 1 CKD


                                    4-1
                          PTYCON COMMAND LANGUAGE                          PTYCON COMMAND LANGUAGE


        CKD-LOG OPERATOR FOO OPERATOR
        DEFINE 2 FIL
        FIL-LOG OPERATOR FOO OPERATOR
        OPR-ENABLE
        OPR-OPR
        CKD-ENABLE
        CKD-CHECKD
        FIL-FILCOM
        NO SILENCE
        WHAT ALL
        CONNECT OPR
          <RET>                  ;Line contains a carriage return

   This processing consists of bringing up OPR  and  any  other  programs
   that you might need such as CHECKD and FILCOM.  If PTYCON does not use
   PTYCON.ATO automatically, you can attach to PTYCON and, after you  see
   the prompt PTYCON>, type:

        GET <SYSTEM>PTYCON.ATO<RET>

   For example,

        @SYSTAT OPERATOR<RET>

           0   DET  SYSJOB  OPERATOR

   You could also follow the GET with a different file  specification  to
   use a special ATO file.

   If the output from SYSTAT OPERATOR showed that PTYCON was not running,
   you must start it yourself.  To do this, type PTYCON at system command
   level.  When PTYCON responds with its prompt, type the GET command  to
   run the auto file.

   It is important to look at this output when the system starts to check
   if the proper programs have been started.  If you attach to the PTYCON
   job, you should also give a WHAT ALL command to PTYCON  to  check  the
   status of these programs.

   The commands to start and control programs under  PTYCON  are  in  the
   file  SYSTEM:PTYCON.ATO.   Your  System Manager must decide what those


                                    4-3
                          PTYCON COMMAND LANGUAGE                          PTYCON COMMAND LANGUAGE


   commands should be.  If they differ from those in the PTYCON.ATO  file
|  supplied,  you  must  change the file with an editor.  The commands in
|  this file can be in uppercase or lowercase.
|  
|  The PTYCON.ATO file normally runs OPR, and any other service  programs
   that your System Manager decides to run as subjobs of PTYCON.



   4.3  COMMUNICATION WITH PTYCON AND ITS SUBJOBS

   PTYCON allows you to start and control  as  many  jobs  as  there  are
|  pseudo  terminals  (PTYs)  in  the system, but never more than 24.  To
|  find out how many PTYs are available on your  system,  type  the  EXEC
|  command  INFORMATION  (ABOUT) AVAILABLE DEVICES.  To find out how many
|  PTYs are in use by PTYCON, type the PTYCON command WHAT ALL.
|  
|  The jobs that are started under PTYCON are called subjobs.  Before you
   try  to  start  a subjob under PTYCON, be sure that PTYCON is running.
   If it is, you should see the prompt PTYCON>.  To get the  prompt,  you
   might  have  to  type  POP  or  the  PTYCON escape character, which is
   <CTRL/X> by default.  (See the CONNECT, PUSH, and REDEFINE commands to
   PTYCON in Section 4.4.)

   When PTYCON is running and has printed its prompt,  PTYCON>,  you  can
   communicate with it or its subjobs in the following ways:

|       1.  You can type a single- or multiple-line PTYCON  command  (see
            Section  4.4,  for  a  complete  description  of  all  PTYCON
            commands).
|  
|       2.  You can type a single-line  subjob  command  to  an  existing
|           subjob.  A subjob command is:
|  
|                PTYCON>n-text

            where n is the subjob name or number and text  is  a  TOPS-20
            command or input to a program running under subjob n.

        3.  You can give the CONNECT command to PTYCON to  connect  to  a
            subjob.  Then you can communicate directly with the subjob by
            typing exactly what you would type to a job not under PTYCON.
            To  later  return  to  PTYCON  command level, type the PTYCON
            escape character, which is <CTRL/X> by default.

        4.  You can give the PUSH command to PTYCON to perform a task  at
            TOPS-20 command level.  You can type commands or run programs
            as you would under any job, but you do not have to log  in  a
            job.  To return to PTYCON command level, type POP.

   In communicating with a subjob, you can use all the  standard  TOPS-20
   features.    You  can  use  <CTRL/C>,  <CTRL/T>,  <CTRL/R>,  <CTRL/U>,


                                    4-4

   recognition, rubout, DDT, EDIT, TV, languages,  and  system  commands.
   However, there are some restrictions.

        1.  You can never pass the current PTYCON escape character  to  a
            subjob,  because  it has a special purpose.  (See the CONNECT
            command in Section 4.4.3.)

        2.  <CTRL/\> (control backslash) cannot be passed  to  a  job  or
            subjob  from  the  CTY,  because  it  causes you to enter the
            console processor command language  (PARSER).   If  you  type
            <CTRL/\> by mistake, immediately type QUIT.

        3.  If you are giving a single-line subjob command like:

                 PTYCON> OPR-ABORT BATCH-STREAM 2<RET>

            you cannot use recognition, because the command is not passed
            to the system until you press RETURN or LINE FEED.
|  
|       4.  <CTRL/H> does not reprint a faulty command up to the point of
|           error.



   4.3.1  Creating Subjobs

   To create a subjob, use either the CONNECT or  DEFINE  command.   When
   you  give  either command with a number that has not yet been assigned
   to a subjob, you create a subjob with that number.  If you type ESCAPE
   in  place  of a number in the DEFINE command, you create a subjob with
   the next free subjob number.  The DEFINE command also  allows  you  to
   associate a name with the subjob.

                                    NOTE

|          Whenever you create a subjob, you must then log in  to
|          get  a system job number, as you do for any other job.
|          If you enable your privileges,  you  can  use  a  null
           password if you log in under the same name that PTYCON
           is logged in under.

   For example, you use CONNECT to create a subjob:

        PTYCON> CONNECT 0<RET>
        [Connected to subjob 0]

        At this point, you can give commands directly to the  job.   When
        you want to return to PTYCON command level, type CTRL/X.

   Once a subjob exists, you can communicate with it by:
|  
|       1.  Sending commands through PTYCON
|  
|       2.  Connecting directly to the subjob
|  
|  
|  
|  4.3.2  Communicating With Subjobs Through PTYCON
|  
|  You can send commands to subjobs while your terminal is at the PTYCON>
|  prompt.  The format is:
|  
|       PTYCON> n-text
|  
|  where
|  
|       n         is the subjob name or number, followed by a hyphen
|  
|       text      is a TOPS-20 command or program input to be sent to the
|                 subjob
|  
|  The subjob name is an alternate way to  specify  a  subjob.   Use  the
|  DEFINE command to define a subjob name.
|  
|  When you are giving commands to a subjob, be sure  that  you  know  if
   your subjob is waiting for program input or if it is at system command
|  level.  The last character output by the subjob is "@" or "$" if it is
|  at  system  command  level,  and  a  program-specific  prompt if it is
   awaiting program input.  If it is awaiting program input and you  want
|  to  give it a system command, first send a <CTRL/C> (followed by <RET>
|  to end the command).  Then, send the desired system command.   In  the
   case  of  OPR  as  a subjob, type EXIT to the OPR> prompt (followed by
   <RET>) to get to system command level.

|  PTYCON accepts single- or  multiple-line  commands  after  the  prompt
|  PTYCON>.   If  the PTYCON command line is longer than the maximum line
|  length allowed by your terminal, you can continue typing  the  command
|  past  the  end  of  the  line and onto the next line, without pressing
|  RETURN.  PTYCON accepts command components that  are  divided  between
|  lines.   If  you  want  to  avoid  divided  words,  use the hyphen (-)
|  continuation character.  At the end of the first line, type  a  hyphen
|  and press RETURN.  Then, continue typing the command on the next line.
|  At the end of the command, press RETURN to confirm the command.
|  
|  The following example sends a multiple line command to a subjob.  Note
|  that  the  first  hyphen separates the subjob number from the command,
|  and the second hyphen (the continue character) continues  the  command
|  onto the next line.

|  4.3.3  Communicating Directly With Subjobs
|  
   To communicate with a subjob by direct  connection,  use  the  CONNECT
   command, type exactly what you want to communicate to the subjob, then
   finish with the PTYCON escape character, normally CTRL/X.

   When you connect to a subjob that has not been logged  in,  the  first
   character that you type causes the identification message to be output
   on your terminal.  For example,

        PTYCON> CONNECT 3<RET>
        [Connected to subjob 3]
        <RET>
|        2102 Development System, TOPS-20 Monitor 6(6136)

   You can also start the subjob OPR with the CONNECT command.   This  is
   helpful  when  OPR has not been started or when you want multiple OPRs
   at your installation.  For example,

        @PTYCON<RET>

        PTYCON>

                                    NOTE

           You cannot send the current PTYCON escape character to
           a subjob, because that character returns you to PTYCON
           command level if you are connected to a subjob, or  it
           aborts  the  current  command  if  you  are  at PTYCON
           command level.  However, you can change that character
           with the REDEFINE command to PTYCON.



   4.3.4  Subjob Output

   You can do the following with the output from subjobs of PTYCON.

        1.  Allow it to be typed on your terminal

        2.  Buffer it until you request it

        3.  Save it in a file

        4.  Discard it

   The PTYCON commands that control the  output  of  the  subjobs  either
   collectively or individually are:





                                    4-9
                          PTYCON COMMAND LANGUAGE                          PTYCON COMMAND LANGUAGE


        1.  ACCEPT

        2.  REFUSE

        3.  LOG

        4.  DISCARD

   If REFUSE is set for a subjob, its output is typed  on  your  terminal
   only  when  you are connected to the subjob.  Otherwise, the output is
   buffered until you request it with the ACCEPT (or NO  REFUSE)  command
   or  until  you connect to the subjob.  If DISCARD is set for a subjob,
   again its output is  printed  on  your  terminal  only  when  you  are
   connected  to  the subjob.  Otherwise, the output is discarded, except
   for recording it in a file if the PTYCON LOG command was given.

   If neither REFUSE nor DISCARD has been set for a subjob, the  subjob's
   output  is  printed  on your terminal.  If PTYCON is at command level,
   output from each subjob is preceded by a header containing the  subjob
   name and/or number and the time.  If you are connected to a subjob:

        1.  All output from the  connected  subjob  is  printed  on  your
            terminal without headers.

        2.  All other subjob output  is  printed  on  your  terminal  and
            preceded by a header containing the name and/or number of the
            subjob giving output and the time.  The output is followed by
            a  trailer containing the name and/or number of the connected
            subjob and the time.

                                    NOTE

           If you are at command level and  you  are  entering  a
           command,  PTYCON  temporarily suspends output from the
           subjobs until the command is confirmed with a carriage
           return or line feed.

   For example, you are connected to subjob 3 and output  is  typed  from
   subjob   0,   which  is  defined  as  OPR,  beginning  with  a  header
   (**** OPR(0) hh:mm:ss ****).   (Where  hh:mm:ss   is   the   time   in
   hours:minutes:seconds.)  When  the  output  from subjob 0 is done, the
   trailer is output, indicating that the currently connected subjob is 3
   (**** 3 hh:mm:ss ****).

        PTYCON> CONNECT 3<RET>

   4.3.5  Logging Out Subjobs

   When you have completely finished using a subjob, you can log  it  out
   and  deassign  its  subjob number with the KILL command.  (See details
   under the KILL command to PTYCON in Section 4.4.9.)

   You can log out a subjob by specifying either the subjob name  or  the
   subjob  number.   For  example,  to  log  out  subjob 0, which is also
   defined as subjob OPR:

        PTYCON> KILL OPR<RET>
        PTYCON>

        or

        PTYCON> KILL 0<RET>
        PTYCON>

   To leave PTYCON permanently, you should be certain that  you  have  no
   more  use  for any of the subjobs; then use KILL ALL and EXIT.  During
   timesharing, you should never do this to  the  PTYCON-controlling  OPR
   and  any other utility program (such as, DUMPER or CHECKD) because you
   might need them to service users.

   For example, you log out all subjobs and EXIT  from  PTYCON  before  a
   system shutdown for preventive maintenance:

        PTYCON> KILL ALL<RET>
        PTYCON> EXIT<RET>
        @

   If you want to leave PTYCON temporarily  to  do  something  at  system
   command level and not use a subjob, use the PUSH command, perform your
   commands, and return to PTYCON with POP.  (See the example  under  the
   PUSH command in Section 4.4.11.)
|  
|  
|  
|  4.4  PTYCON COMMAND FEATURES
|  
|  PTYCON has the same command recognition, question  mark,  and  control
|  character  features  offered  by  the  EXEC,  OPR,  and  other TOPS-20
|  programs.  Following is a summary of these features:

|  4.4.1  Listing Available Commands And Arguments With A Question Mark
|  
|  
|       1.  To list all the PTYCON commands, type a question mark at  the
|           PTYCON prompt.
|  
|           PTYCON> ? a command, one of the following:
|           ACCEPT  BELL     CONNECT  DEFINE  DISCARD  EXIT      GET

|           SAVE    SILENCE  WHAT
|            or a subjob name, ALL
|            or a subjob number
|           PTYCON>
|  
|       2.  To list all the PTYCON commands that  begin  with  a  certain
|           letter, type the letter followed by a question mark.
|  
|           PTYCON> R?  a command, one of the following:
|           REDEFINE   REFUSE
|           PTYCON>
|  
|       3.  To list the arguments to a PTYCON command, type  the  command
|           name followed by a space and a question mark.
|  
|           PTYCON> CONNECT ?  subjob number or subjob name
|           PTYCON>
|  
|  
|  
|  4.4.2  Using Recognition Input
|  
|  PTYCON recognition input works with commands and subjob names.  To use
|  recognition  input, type enough letters of a command or subjob name to
|  make it unique,  and  then  type  <ESC>.   PTYCON  responds  with  the
|  remainder  of  the  command  and its guidewords or the complete subjob
|  name.
|  
|  PTYCON recognizes command names before subjob names.  For example,  if
|  you  have  a  subjob  named LOOK and you type LO<ESC>, PTYCON responds
|  with the LOG command.

   ACCEPT - Accepting Output On Your Terminal


   Function   Function

        The ACCEPT command sets your terminal to receive output from  the
        specified subjobs.


   Formats   Formats

        PTYCON> ACCEPT n,...,n

        PTYCON> ACCEPT ALL

        or

        PTYCON> NO ACCEPT n,...,n

        PTYCON> NO ACCEPT ALL


   Argument   Argument

        n                  specifies a subjob number.  You can specify up
                           to  24  (0  -  23) subjob numbers separated by
                           commas.  If you defined a name for the subjob,
                           you can specify the name instead of the subjob
                           number.


   Characteristics   Characteristics

        The ACCEPT command is the normal mode of operation.

        When  used  after  NO  ACCEPT  or  REFUSE,  the  ACCEPT   command
        immediately  types on your terminal any available output from the
        specified subjobs and continues to do so as it becomes available.
        If  you  do not specify any subjobs, ALL is automatically printed
        and assumed.

        NO ACCEPT is equivalent to REFUSE.  If you  do  not  specify  any
        subjobs, ALL is assumed.

            PTYCON>

        2.  You specify NO ACCEPT for subjobs 7, 15, 19,  and  23,  which
            are  OPRs,  so  that  your terminal receives output only from
            subjob OPR(0):

            PTYCON> NO ACCEPT 7,15,19,23<RET>

   BELL - Sounding Bell For Output Waiting


   Function   Function

|       The BELL command rings your terminal bell ten seconds to indicate
        that  a subjob has output waiting to be printed on your terminal.
        This is referred to as a refused subjob.


   Formats   Formats

        PTYCON> BELL

        or

        PTYCON> NO BELL


   Characteristics   Characteristics

        The BELL command is the normal mode of operation.

        Therefore, you need to give the BELL command only when  you  want
        to cancel a NO BELL command that you previously issued.

        When you give the PUSH command to PTYCON,  the  output  from  all
        subjobs  is  refused, unless it is already being discarded (refer
        to the DISCARD command, Section 4.4.5).  The  BELL  command  also
        applies to these refused subjobs.

        NO BELL suppresses any bell, indicating that a refused subjob has
        some  output.   Consequently,  you  are  not warned that there is
        output waiting.


   Example   Example

        1.  You specify NO BELL to turn off the  bell  sound  for  output
            waiting:

            PTYCON> NO BELL<RET>
            PTYCON>

   CONNECT - Connecting To A Subjob


   Function   Function

        The CONNECT command connects your terminal to a specified subjob,
        such  that the subjob appears to be a normal timesharing job that
        is not running under PTYCON.


   Format   Format

        PTYCON> CONNECT n


   Argument   Argument

        n                  specifies a subjob number.   You  can  specify
                           any  number  from  0  to 23.  If you defined a
                           name for  the  subjob,  you  can  specify  the
                           subjob name instead of the subjob number.


   Characteristics   Characteristics

        After issuing the CONNECT command, all commands that you type are
        passed  directly  to  the subjob until you type the PTYCON escape
        character, which is CTRL/X by  default.   You  can  redefine  the
        escape character with the REDEFINE command to PTYCON.

        As soon as you connect to  a  subjob,  you  receive  the  message
        [Connected  to  subjob name(n)] or [Connected to subjob n].  Then
        any output that was being buffered for that subjob by the  REFUSE
        or NO ACCEPT command is printed on your terminal.

        If you do not specify a subjob,  PTYCON  connects  your  terminal
        either  to  the  last  connected  subjob  or  to  the last subjob
        defined, whichever was done most  recently.   If  you  specify  a
        valid  subjob number that you have not defined, a new subjob with
        that number is created for you.  However, you  cannot  specify  a
        subjob name that has not been defined.

        When you are connected  to  a  subjob,  type  the  PTYCON  escape
        character,  CTRL/X by default, to return to PTYCON.  Then you see
        the PTYCON prompt.

   DEFINE - Defining A Subjob


   Function   Function

        The DEFINE command defines a subjob.  For example, it can  create
        a new subjob, and it can associate a name with a subjob.  You can
        also define a new name for  an  existing  subjob  by  giving  the
        DEFINE command again with the desired new name.


   Format   Format

        PTYCON> DEFINE number name


   Arguments   Arguments

        number             specifies the subjob  number  to  be  defined.
                           You  can  specify any number from 0 to 23.  If
                           you press ESCape twice after you  type  DEFINE
                           (see  Example  1.),  the  system uses the next
                           available number.

        name               specifies an optional  name  for  the  subjob.
                           The   name   can   consist   of   up  to  five
                           alphanumeric   characters.    PTYCON    simply
                           ignores   any   characters   after  the  fifth
                           character.  If  you  use  any  nonalphanumeric
                           characters,  PTYCON  also ignores them and the
                           characters  that  follow  the  nonalphanumeric
                           characters.


   Characteristics   Characteristics

        If you press ESCape for the subjob number, the next  free  subjob
        number  in  the system is chosen.  This is the recommended way to
        define a new subjob.

        If you define a subjob with  a  name  already  given  to  another
        subjob, you get the message:

        % Name already in use, reassigned to this subjob



                                    4-20
                          PTYCON COMMAND LANGUAGE                          PTYCON COMMAND LANGUAGE


        and the name is given to the new  subjob.   Also,  defined  names
        take  precedence  over subjob numbers when you define a subjob to
        be another number.  If ALL is the name of a subjob, whenever  you
        use ALL in a PTYCON command, it refers only to that subjob.


   Examples   Examples

        1.  You DEFINE the next available subjob number as DUMPER:

                        <ESC>        <ESC>

   DISCARD - Eliminating Subjob Output


   Function   Function

        The DISCARD command eliminates output to your terminal  from  the
        specified subjob when you are not connected to that subjob.


   Formats   Formats

        PTYCON> DISCARD n,...,n

        PTYCON> DISCARD ALL

        or

        PTYCON> NO DISCARD n,...,n

        PTYCON> NO DISCARD ALL


   Argument   Argument

        n                  specifies a subjob number.  You can specify up
                           to  24  (0  -  23) subjob numbers separated by
                           commas.  If you defined a name for the subjob,
                           you can specify the subjob name instead of the
                           subjob number.


   Characteristics   Characteristics

        The output is thrown away as far as your  terminal  is  concerned
        with  the  use  of the DISCARD command.  However, output from the
        subjob does go into the LOG file, if you  previously  issued  the
        LOG command to PTYCON.

        DISCARD differs from REFUSE, because REFUSE keeps the output  for
        acceptance  at  a  later  time.   Yet,  if you discard a subjob's
        output after you have refused it, the output buffered  by  REFUSE
        is  not  typed  on  your  terminal.   However, at the time of the
        DISCARD, any output buffered by REFUSE goes into  the  LOG  file,
        providing the LOG command to PTYCON is in effect.

                          PTYCON COMMAND LANGUAGE                          PTYCON COMMAND LANGUAGE


        NO DISCARD, which is the normal mode, allows all output to appear
        on your terminal.  However, if you issued a REFUSE for the subjob
        before the DISCARD, NO DISCARD  puts the  output  of  the  subjob
        back  into  REFUSE  mode and buffers the output.  (See the REFUSE
        command in Section 4.4.13.)


   Example   Example

        1.  You DISCARD the output to your terminal for subjobs 3, 4, and
            5:

   EXIT - Leaving PTYCON Command Level


   Function   Function

        The EXIT command exits from PTYCON and gets you  back  to  system
        command level.


   Format   Format

        PTYCON> EXIT


   Characteristics   Characteristics

        Use the EXIT command only when  you  want  to  permanently  leave
        PTYCON.   To  return  to  system  command level temporarily while
        subjobs are running, use the PUSH command.

        If there are subjobs active when you type EXIT, you get:

             Caution: Exiting may log out the still active subjobs!
             Confirm:  (type CONTROL-A to get back to PTYCON)

        where "A" is the current  PTYCON  escape  character.   Type  that
        control  character to return to PTYCON immediately.  If you press
        RETURN to CONFIRM, you exit from PTYCON and you  might  lose  the
        subjobs.


   Hint   Hint

        If  you  mistakenly  type  EXIT  and  press  RETURN  to  CONFIRM,
        immediately  type  CONTINUE  to return to PTYCON and preserve any
        subjobs.

        If you first run a program or give some  command  and  then  type
        CONTINUE,  you  might not be able to get back to PTYCON.  If this
        happens, subjobs become detached and are automatically logged out
        in five minutes unless corrective measures are taken.  Therefore,
        to recover them, immediately run PTYCON again.   Then,  for  each
        subjob  that  became detached, connect to a new subjob and attach
        to a system job corresponding to a  detached  subjob.   (Use  the
        SYSTAT  command  to  see  what jobs were detached.) Note that you

        cannot refer to the former  subjob  numbers;  you  must  use  the
        system job numbers until you establish PTYCON subjobs again.


   Examples   Examples

        1.  You EXIT from PTYCON,  but  you  have  not  killed  all  your
            subjobs.   Press  CTRL/X  to  return to PTYCON, KILL ALL your
            subjobs, and then EXIT:

            PTYCON> EXIT<RET>
            Caution:  Exiting may log out the still active subjobs!
            Confirm:  (type CTRL/X to get back to PTYCON)^X

        2.  You attach system jobs 6 and 7 that became detached  and  you
            make them subjobs with their former names (TV and EDIT):

        3.  You issued the EXIT command and five minutes have passed  and

   GET - Executing An Auto-File



   Function   Function

        The GET command reads and executes the commands in the  specified
        file.


   Format   Format

        PTYCON> GET filespec


   Argument   Argument

        filespec           specifies the file specification of  the  file
                           that   contains  the  PTYCON  commands  to  be
                           executed automatically.

                                Default|                               Default filename and type - PTYCON.ATO


   Characteristics   Characteristics

        When the system is first started, SYSJOB normally  starts  PTYCON
        and  has PTYCON do a GET on SYSTEM:PTYCON.ATO.  When the commands
        in the file are processed, they are echoed on your terminal as if
        they had been typed in directly (unless SILENCE is in effect).


   Hints   Hints

        Certain characters in the command file must be typed  differently
        than  if  they  were  typed  directly  on your terminal.  Control
        characters must be typed as ^a,  where  ^  is  the  up-arrow,  or
        circumflex,  and  "a"  is the character.  Do not use the CTRL key
        for typing control characters in the command file.   ESCape  must
        be  typed  as  two  characters  ^$  (up-arrow  dollar-sign).   An
        up-arrow must be typed as ^^ (two up-arrows).

|       The PTYCON command file can contain leading and  trailing  spaces
|       and tabs, lowercase letters and blank lines.

        When you run PTYCON under OPERATOR (the  normal  case),  for  any
        subjob  you  log  in  under  OPERATOR,  you can give a fictitious
        password, for example, FOO in the examples below.


   Examples   Examples

        1.  The  following  is  a  sample  SYSTEM:PTYCON.ATO  file   with
            comments added:

            SILENCE                        ;silence output to CTY
            LOG                            ;create LOG file PTYCON.LOG

            ^X                             ;return to PTYCON
            NO SILENCE                     ;allow output to CTY
            WHAT ALL                       ;print status of subjob 

            You now execute the PTYCON.ATO file with the GET command:

            @PTYCON<RET>
            PTYCON> GET SYSTEM:PTYCON.ATO<RET>
            PTYCON> SILENCE

        2.  The following is a  sample  special  ATO  file  that  creates
            subjob 5 as DUMPER with comments added:

            LOG                            ;create LOG file PTYCON.LOG
            CONNECT 5                      ;connect to subjob 5
            <RET>                          ;Line contains a carriage

   KILL - Killing PTYCON Subjobs


   Function   Function

        The KILL command kills the indicated subjobs (logs them out)  and
        deassigns  the  subjob  numbers,  provided that PTYCON is running
        with OPERATOR or WHEEL capability enabled, or  that  the  subjobs
        are logged in under the same user name as PTYCON.


   Formats   Formats

        PTYCON> KILL n,...,n

        or

        PTYCON> KILL ALL


   Argument   Argument

        n                  specifies a subjob number.  You can specify up
                           to  24  (0  - 23) subjobs separated by commas.
                           If you defined a name for the subjob, you  can
                           use the name instead of the subjob number.


   Characteristics   Characteristics

        If the subjob is not logged in under the same user as PTYCON, the
        KILL command does not succeed, and you receive the message:

             Could not kill subjob n

        Then, you must connect to the subjob, log out, return to  PTYCON,
        and  issue  the  KILL command.  For KILL ALL you must type ALL in
        its entirety.

        The KILL command  is  necessary  to  deassign  a  subjob  number.
        Simply logging out a subjob does not deassign the subjob number.

   LOG - Recording Interactions With PTYCON


   Function   Function

        The LOG  command  causes  all  interactions  with  PTYCON  to  be
        recorded in the specified file specification.


   Formats   Formats

   Argument   Argument

        filespec           specifies the file specification of  the  file
                           that  contains  the  recording of interactions
                           with PTYCON and its subjobs.

                                Default|                               Default file name and type - PTYCON.LOG


   Characteristics   Characteristics

        If you specify a file that already  exists,  any  new  output  is
        appended  after  the  last  entry of the existing file.  Use this
        command to keep a  record  of  what  was  typed  at  the  console
        terminal.

        NO LOG, which is the normal mode, stops output to a log file  and
        closes  the  file.  This is the only command that stops output to
        the LOG file.

        Once the LOG command is  given,  the  log  file  contains  PTYCON
        prompts,  commands, and error messages, all input to subjobs, and
        all output from subjobs.  The order of information  in  the  file
        resembles the input and output to PTYCON at your terminal.

        If you do a DISCARD for a subjob, or GET a file that  contains  a
        SILENCE  command,  the log file contains all interactions as they
        occur, but your terminal  output  does  not.   (See  DISCARD  and
        SILENCE.)

        When you do a DISCARD for a subjob after a REFUSE, the  log  file
        gets  all  the  output  buffered by the REFUSE, and then gets all
        output from the subjob as it occurs.  However, your terminal does
        not  get  output  from  a  subjob once a DISCARD command has been
        issued.


   Examples   Examples

        1.  You specify LOG with a filename of  NOV18-79  to  record  all
            interactions with PTYCON.  The default file type is LOG.

            PTYCON> LOG NOV18-79<RET>
            PTYCON>

        2.  You specify NO LOG after system startup to close the log file
            from  the  PTYCON.ATO  and then you create a new log file for
            the day's interactions with PTYCON.

            PTYCON> NO LOG<RET>
            PTYCON> LOG DEC28.TXT<RET>

   PUSH - Performing Tasks At EXEC Level


   Function   Function

        The PUSH command allows you to perform a task at  system  command
        level without affecting subjobs.


   Format   Format

        PTYCON> PUSH


   Characteristics   Characteristics

        When you give the  PUSH  command,  the  output  from  subjobs  is
        suspended.  Like REFUSE, PUSH causes a bell or beep to sound when
        output is waiting, providing the BELL command is in effect.  When
        you return to PTYCON, waiting output is printed on your terminal.

        The advantage of this command is that you  do  not  have  to  use
        another subjob or job number to do a task at system command level
        (EXEC level).  However, commands given after a PUSH  from  PTYCON
        and before a POP are not entered in the LOG file.


   Hint   Hint

        To return to PTYCON, type POP.


   Restriction   Restriction

        You cannot give the LOGOUT command when you have  PUSHed  out  of
        PTYCON.   If  you  do,  you  receive  the following error message
        instead of being logged out:

             ?LOG capability required
              Not logged off

        This prevents you  from  accidently  losing  your  subjobs  under
        PTYCON.

                           commas.  If  you  specified  a  name  for  the
                           subjob,   you  can  specify  the  subjob  name
                           instead of the subjob number.  If you  do  not
                           give a subjob name or number, ALL is assumed.


   Characteristics   Characteristics

        A bell or beep sounds every ten seconds if a refused  subjob  has
        output waiting.  (See the BELL command to PTYCON, Section 4.4.2.)
        Because the output is buffered, you can later get the  output  on
        your  terminal by typing ACCEPT or NO REFUSE for the subjob or by
        connecting to the subjob.  At  that  time,  the  output  is  also
        written into the log file, providing the PTYCON LOG command is in
        effect.

|       filespec       specifies the file specification of the file  that
|                      contains   the   recording  of  inputs  to  PTYCON
|                      subjobs.

   Characteristics   Characteristics

        If you specify a file that  already  exists,  all  new  input  to
        subjobs is recorded after the last entry in the existing file.

        NO SAVE, which is the normal mode, stops recording and closes the
        file.    This  is  the  only  command  that  stops  output  to  a
        saved-input file.

        The SAVE command  records  only  the  input  to  PTYCON  subjobs.
        PTYCON  prompts,  commands, error messages, and subjob output are
        not recorded.


   Hint   Hint

        The SAVE command can be used to create a command file such  as  a
        PTYCON.ATO  or a batch control file.  Edit the file to delete the
        file  header  and  any  editing  control  characters  that   were
        recorded, such as <CTRL/U> and <CTRL/W>.

                          PTYCON COMMAND LANGUAGE                          PTYCON COMMAND LANGUAGE


        If the file is to be executed with the PTYCON  GET  command,  use
        CONNECT commands to direct input to the proper subjobs.


   Restriction   Restriction

        Command-recognition input  is  not  recorded  accurately  in  the
        saved-input  file.   For  example,  if  you  give  the EXEC START
        command by typing ST<ESC>, the EXEC responds with ART  (PROGRAM).
        However,  the  saved-input  file contains only the letters ST and
        the escape symbol, ^$.


   Examples   Examples

        1.  You specify SAVE with a saved-input file name of  OPR-CMD.TXT
            to record all input to PTYCON subjobs.

            PTYCON> SAVE OPR-CMD.TXT
            PTYCON>

        2.  You specify NO SAVE to close the saved-input file,  and  then
            you create a new saved-input file.

   SILENCE - Silencing Output To Your Terminal



   Function   Function

        The SILENCE command silences any output that  would  normally  be
        output on your terminal while PTYCON processes the file specified
        in the GET command.


   Formats   Formats

        SILENCE

        or

        NO SILENCE


   Characteristics   Characteristics

        The SILENCE and NO SILENCE commands are effective only when given
        in the file on which you do a GET.

        SILENCE does not stop output to a log file.

        NO SILENCE, which is the normal mode, allows all output  on  your
        terminal  while  PTYCON  processes  the  file  specified in a GET
        command.


   Hint   Hint

        If you have a SILENCE command in a file on which you intend to do
        a  GET, you should then include a NO SILENCE in the file.  If you
        do not include  the  NO  SILENCE  command,  the  SILENCE  command
        suppresses the last PTYCON prompt on your terminal.


   Examples   Examples

        1.  Your PTYCON.ATO file  might  contain  SILENCE  as  the  first
            command  to  silence  output  to  your  terminal  when SYSJOB
            executes the GET PTYCON.ATO command at system startup.

        2.  In the same PTYCON.ATO file above,  the  NO  SILENCE  command

   WHAT - Displaying The Status Of Subjobs


   Function   Function

        The WHAT command gives you a status report for specified subjobs.


   Formats   Formats

        PTYCON> WHAT n

        or

        PTYCON> WHAT ALL


   Argument   Argument

        n                  specifies the subjob number.  You can  specify
                           any  number  from 0 to 23.  If you specified a
                           name for the subjob, you can specify the  name
                           instead  of the subjob number.  If you specify
                           a non-existent subjob number, the message:

                                Subjob "n" not in use.

                           appears on your terminal (n is the number  you
                           specified).   If  there  are  no  subjobs, the
                           message  None   active!    appears   on   your
                           terminal.


   Characteristics   Characteristics

        If you do not specify a subjob  number  or  name  with  the  WHAT
        command,  PTYCON  gives the status for all the subjobs.  One line
        of information is given for each subjob.

        The information for a logged-in subjob is:

        1.  Subjob name    (if it has one)

        2.  Subjob number  (in parentheses if there is a subjob name)

        3.  System job number

        4.  User logged in under the subjob

        5.  Program running under the subjob

        6.  State of the job:

            a.  RN meaning running

            b.  TI meaning ready for terminal input

            c.  TO meaning the subjob has terminal output waiting

            d.  Any of the three  above  followed  by  (R),  meaning  the
                REFUSE  or NO ACCEPT command is in effect for the subjob,
                or (D), meaning the DISCARD command is in effect for  the
                subjob

        7.  Run time of the job is in hours:minutes:seconds

|       The information for a subjob that is defined but  not  logged  in
|       is:

        1.  Subjob name    (if it has one)

        2.  Subjob number  (in parentheses if there is a subjob name)

        3.  System job number  (if assigned, or, if the subjob  has  only
            been defined, the message:  NO JOB NUMBER ASSIGNED)

        4.  Message:  NOT LOGGED IN  (if the login is not complete)

        5.  State of the job  (see above)

        6.  Run time of the job  (hours:minutes:seconds)
