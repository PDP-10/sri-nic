1.  If your FILENAME-INPUT switch is set to HERMES, you
    can type ! before you input a filename and then input
    the filename in TENEX or TOPS-20 form.

2.  ! is the "silent bell" marker for the CHANGE command in the
    DRAFT-EDITOR.

    Note: The "I" subcommand in the CHANGE command allows you to
    insert text within a line.

    If the CHANGE-BELL switch is set to BELL, the beginning of
    the insertion is not marked and the end of the insertion is
    marked with the ringing of the terminal bell.

    If the CHANGE-BELL switch is set to !, the beginning and end 
    of the insertion are marked with !. The ! is printed on the
    terminal but is not included in the text.
You have your FILENAME-INPUT switch set to HERMES, but you
wish to GET a message-file named OLD.MSGS;1.

>GET ?
MESSAGE
SAVED-MSGS
>GET !OLD.MSGS;1<CR>

The fact that your FILENAME-INPUT switch was set to HERMES,
allowed you to type ? within the GET command.  The ? showed
you all the files in your directory that followed HERMES
filename conventions, i.e., had the TENEX form MESSAGE.TXT;1
and SAVED-MSGS.TXT;3.  The extensions and versions were not
shown in HERMES, but could be seen if you used the TENEX
DIRECTORY command.

If most of the files you deal with have extensions other than
TXT or HRM, you should consider either renaming the files
or changing your FILENAME-INPUT
switch to TENEX.

To rename files, quit Hermes and use the RENAME command
at the @ prompt.
TOPS-20 differs from TENEX only in the form of the filename,
i.e., SAVED-MSGS.TXT.3 instead of SAVED-MSGS.TXT;3, and in
the fact that the name of the "Inbox" file is MAIL.TXT.1
instead of MESSAGE.TXT;1.

As you compose a message, Hermes automatically creates a backup
draft-file with the name $DRAFT-BACKUP-month-day-time.  This file
is automatically deleted if the session ends normally, but
remains in your directory if the session ends abnormally, for
example, if the system "crashes".

To restore an entire draft from the $DRAFT backup file:

>RESTORE $D<ESC>RAFT-BACKUP-APR-9-156PM<CR>

For more information, see the related topic, BACKUP-FOR-DRAFTS.

When you begin to create a Text: field, Hermes creates a backup
draft-file, with the name $TEXT-BACKUP-month-day-time.  This file
is automatically updated every two minutes.  It is automatically
deleted when you complete the Text: field.

     NOTE: The Text: field is completed when you type <CTRL-Z>,
           or, if you use one of the auxiliary editors, EMACS,
           TECO, WE or XED, when you return to the >> prompt.

If the Hermes session ends abnormally before you complete the
Text: field, the $TEXT file remains in your directory.  It
contains most of the text you entered in the Text: field,
although it may not contain the material you typed in the final
two minutes before the crash.  You can use APPEND-FILE or
<CTRL-B> to place it in the Text: field of your draft message.

If you have previously used the RESTORE command with the $DRAFT
file, you may have an earlier version of the Text: field in your
draft.  In that case, you will want to ERASE it before you use
APPEND-FILE or <CTRL-B> with the $TEXT file.

>>ERASE Text:<CR>
>>APPEND-FILE $T<ESC>EXT-BACKUP-APR-9-156PM (to field) <ESC>Text:<CR>

or

>>ERASE Text:<CR>
>>Text: <CR>
<CTRL-B>
Input from file: $T<ESC>EXT-BACKUP-APR-9-156PM<CR>

% = A general symbol for the "last one".

At the > prompt, % means the last message in the current
message-file.

In the DRAFT-EDITOR, at the >> prompt, % means the last line in
the field.  (The Text: field is the default.)

In other editors, % the last one of the things you are editing,
e.g., the last line in a template or the last message-record in
the RECORD-OF-MESSSAGE-FILES.

This prints all the messages in the file.  You can refer

1:%

The plus-sign, +, can have three different meanings:

1.  If a template contains the template item "Status:", a RECENT
    message causes a "+" to appear in the Status: field.

2.  In printing templates, "+" following an item causes it to be
    labelled with its name or to appear in an expanded form.
    For example, if a template contains the template item
    "Status:+", a RECENT message causes the word "RECENT" to
    appear in the Status: field.

3.  In composing templates, "+" following an item causes the
    system to print the field name as a prompt before pausing to
    allow the user to enter the contents of the field.

+> is the Hermes prompt signal for subcommands that override
switches.  To get the +> prompt, type a comma before typing the

possible subcommands.  End the subcommands by typing a
carriage-return at the +> prompt.

Commands with subcommands are: COMPOSE, EXCHANGE, EXIT, EXPLODE,
EXPUNGE, FILE, FORMAT, FORWARD, GET, MOVE, QUIT, REDISTRIBUTE,
REFILE, REPLY, RESTORE-DRAFT, SAVE-FIELD, SEARCH, SEND, and SHOW
(at the >> prompt).

selects the messages that fit any one.  The comma acts as the
"union" operator.

.  Period or dot; symbol for CMESSAGE.

/ Slash.  In specification of messages (in commands such as

specification that comes after the slash to place a
restriction on anything before the slash.  Message numbers
cannot be used after the slash, but named sequences can.

:  Colon

  1.  In sequences, 5:10 means messages 5 through 10; following
      an object, shows that object is a field of CDRAFT.

  2.  All Hermes field-names end with a colon.

  3.  Groupnames in addressee fields end with a colon, and the
      list of addressees hidden in a groupname ends with " :".

Syntax:  >; <text><CR>
Defaults:    none
		
The single-character command ";" allows you to type a
one-line string of characters that has no effect on HERMES.
The ";" line is terminated by a <CR>.

The most common reason for using ";" is to "talk" to someone
who has linked to you through the TENEX Exec command "Link".

The HERMES command "TALK" is like ";", but is terminated by
<CTRL-Z>.

; Semicolon in message specifications (in commands such as
PRINT, FILE, DELETE, etc.), lets you create composite
specifications.  The semicolon begins a new specification.
The action of the "/" stops at the preceding ";".

" @ " or by " at ".

\  Backslash; printed out by <CTRL-A>.

^   Up Arrow.  Prints the PREVIOUS message in the current
    sequence, CSEQUENCE, on your terminal.  The template used
    is always the PTEMPLATE.

When CSEQUENCE is set to its initial setting of ALL the messages
in the message-file, ^ decreases the current message (the
CMESSAGE or ".") by one.  This allows you to step through your
message-file in reverse, reading your messages one by one.
>print 5<cr>     prints message no. 5
>^               prints message no. 4
The current message, (CMESSAGE-.) is set to 4.
	
Syntax:      ABORT<CR>
		
ABORT cancels an editing session entirely, leaving the state
of affairs exactly as it was before the user entered the
editor.

(EXAMPLE exists.)
Suppose the user were in the FILTER-EDITOR and accidentally
made several unwanted changes:

     f->ABORT<CR>
     >

The single-arrow prompt indicates HERMES has cancelled the
session and returned to the top command level.

The Hermes Active-Environment consists of the Hermes objects
that the user can change and that are normally stored in the
Hermes profile.

     The current filter, CFILTER. 

     The current templates, CTEMPLATE, PTEMPLATE, etc.

     The current destinations, FDESTINATION and LDESTINATION.

     The settings of SWITCHES.

     The contents of USER-FIELDS.

     User-created filters.

     User-created templates.

When you enter Hermes, your Active-Environment is set to a copy
of your Profile.
At top command level:
Syntax:    >ADD <messages>  <sequence> <sequence>... <CR>
Defaults:        CMESSAGE        none

In the SEQUENCE-EDITOR:
Syntax:    s->ADD <messages><CR>
Defaults:            none

     ADD can be used as a top level command or as a subcommand of
the SEQUENCE-EDITOR.  When used in the SEQUENCE-EDITOR, additions
can be made only to the sequence being edited.  When used as a
top level command, you can specify any number of named-sequences
to add messages to.

(EXAMPLE exists.)
>EDIT JONESMITH<CR>
s->SHOW<CR>
1,9,2,3,11
     The sequence contains five messages.
s->ADD FROM: SMITH/CC: JONES<CR>
s->DONE<CR>
     SHOW and ADD can be used at top command level.
>SHOW JONESMITH<CR>
1,9,2,3,11,4,13
     The ADD command caused messages 4 and 13 to be added.
     Successive additions continue the build-up process.
>ADD 2,3,7,15<ESC> (to sequence named) JONESMITH<ESC> (and to
     sequence named) WIDGETS<CR>

>SHOW<CR>

Should addressee-type fields (To:, Cc: and Bcc:, and
user-fields that end in -(ADDRESSEE), -(ADDR) or -(PEOPLE))
be automatically formatted?
	
  ADDRESS-FORMAT       Ask       [X]Yes          No

If this switch is set to Yes, formatting occurs every time
new addressees are appended to an addressee field.

Syntax: >><addressee-field> <addressee-list><CR>

An addressee-field may be To:, Cc:, Bcc:, Reply-To: or an
ADDRESSEE-type user-field.

The <addressee-list> is a series of one or more <name spec>s,
separated by commas.  A <name spec> has one of the following
forms:
	
<name>@<host>
    user at an ARPA host computer.  The "@" may be replaced
    by " at " or by " @ ".  If you do not type in the host,
    Hermes inserts the local host.

<name>@<host>(<string>)
    user with an Attention Subfield.  The <string> must NOT
    contain a <space>, <ESC>, <LF> or <CR>, but may contain
    commas or periods.

@<host>, <name1>, <name2>, <name3>, ...
    several users at the same host.

When you SHOW the draft message, the addressee-fields may appear
in a form different from the way you typed them.  The host names
of users on the local computer are always shown, and an "Attn:"
is inserted in the Attention subfield.  

Before the message is sent, the SHOW TYPED-FORM command shows the
field as you typed it in, including modifcations made by the
MFDB, if any.

>>Show TypedForm<cr>

In the current version of HERMES, it is possible to search on a
name at a host (local or remote), but not on the attention-
subfield.  However, the attention-subfields are displayed along
with the rest of the Addressee-Field, and may be used to alert
members of a group sharing the same message-file.

Each <name> and <host> is parsed as it is typed in.  HERMES will
refuse to accept an incorrect local name or host name.  For a
list of local names, consult your local computer center.

For a list of host names, consult the Arpanet Directory or type:

>>To: @?

(Example exists.)
| If you are on the BBNA host computer, and you type:
|
| >>To: Smith, Brown,(=Brown@BBNG), @USC-ECL,Jones,
| Lee(Good-Guys)<cr>
|
| The SHOW command at the >> prompt displays the field as it 
| appears in all copies of the final message, after it is sent.
|
| >>SHOW TO<cr>
| To: Smith at BBNA, Brown at BBNG, Jones at USC-ECL, 
|     Lee at USC-ECL (Attn: Good-Guys).
|
| IMPROVED SEARCHING FOR ADDRESSEE FIELDS
| 
| When you give a Hermes command that contains a message
| specification, you can now use almost the same kind of
| specification for the addressee fields, To:, Cc:, Bcc:
| and Sender:, that you have always been able to use for
| line-type fields such as From: and Sender:.  It is still
| not possible to search the Attn: subfield, however.
| 
| For example, the specification:
| 
| >SURVEY To: om<CR>
| 
| selects the usernames "Momerath" and "OMalley", as well
| as the groupname "Commons:"  and the host "DARCOM-KA".
| In previous versions of Hermes, you could specify only
| the beginning substring so that "To: om" would select
| only "OMalley".
| 
| Despite this change, Hermes still treats the addressee
| fields as structured fields, and recognizes that "@" is
| the same as " at ".  Therefore, although you may receive
| messages with both "@" and " at " in the addressee
| fields, you can use the following specifications
| interchangeably:
| 
| Name@Host         e.g.  Dodds@BBNA
| "Name at Host"    e.g.  "Dodds at BBNA"
| Name^V at^V Host  e.g.  Dodds^V at^V BBNA
| 
| where ^V = Control-V (the TENEX/TOPS-20 quote character)
   For naming (and hiding) addressee lists.
   Lists of addressees may be stored as draft-files, or placed
   in templates as literal template items.
   These fields do NOT cause messages to be sent to the addressees
   but they are useful for sending addressee lists to others.

If you want to save a list of addressees, you can create the list
in the To or Cc field of a message, and then use the SAVE-FIELD
command to store the contents of the field in a draft-file.

Later, the draft-file can be inserted in another message with
either the APPEND-FILE command, or with the <CTRL-B>.

You can create a template that has a literal item consisting of
an addressee-field containing the addresse-list by using the
<CTRL-B>.

If you want to send an addressee-list to another user, first
create an addressee-type user field, then place the
addressee-list in the field, using APPEND-FILE or <CTRL-B>.

NOTE: HERMES does not insert host names for the Sender's host
computer.  Don't be alarmed.  If you receive a message from
another host with an addressee list in it, you can use the REPLY
command, or the EDIT MESSAGE (or EXPLODE) command.  HERMES will
compare the SENDER's host with your host and add the correct host
names to the addressees on the list.

If you want to include the host name of your own computer
explicitly in a addressee list, edit the list with the Hermes
CHANGE command.  If you wish, you may use an editing program,
such as Teco or Xed.
   Rules for specifying names and hosts.  Use of SHOW
   TYPED-FORM.
   For naming (and hiding) addressee-lists.
   For sending addressee lists in messages.
	
          <name>-(ADDRESSEES)
Syntax:   <name>-(ADDR)       <addressee-list>  <CR>
          <name>-(PEOPLE)
		
This is an addressee-field, similar to the To: field.  It may
contain any list of addressees, separated by commas.  A <CR>
terminates the field.  To continue to another line, type a comma
before the <CR>.

The purpose of User-Fields of the ADDRESSEE type is to send
addressee-lists to other users.  These fields do NOT cause HERMES
to transmit copies of the message to the addressees in the field
when you give the SEND command.

ADDRESSEE-LISTS: All addressee fields, whether they are To, Cc,
Bcc or user-fields, contain NO host names for the Sender's host
computer.  Don't be alarmed.  If you receive a message from
another host with an addressee list in it, you can EXPLODE the
message and HERMES will compare the SENDER's host with your host
and add the correct host names to the addressees on the list.

If you want to include the host name of your own computer in a
addressee list, use an editing program, such as Teco or Xed, to
make up the original addressee-list, and insert it in the
addressee field with <CTRL-B> or APPEND-FILE.  Be sure to check
the addressee field.

(EXAMPLE exists.)
>>BBNA-(ADDRESSEES): @BBNA,MOOERS,MYER,STEVENS<CR>
>>BBND-(ADDR): @BBND,DODDS,HENDERSON,JMILLER,ULMER,VITTAL<CR>

                  @BBNA,MOOERS,STEVENS,MYER<CR>
   Rules for specifying names and hosts.  Use of
   SHOW TYPED-FORM.

This template item is for use in printing templates only.

ALWAYS-DASHED-TEXT prints the Text: field, then always prints
one line of seven dashes (hyphens), whether or not such a
line occurs in the original message.
   Prints Text: field; never prints line of dashes.
   Prints Text: field exactly as received.  May be used in 
   composing templates.
At top command level:

Syntax:    >APPEND <field> <messages>  <CR>
Default:             ---    CMESSAGE

The APPEND command allows the user to add a new or additional
Keyword:, Subject: or Reference: field to a message in a
message-file, without modifying any of the original fields.

The use of APPEND for adding Subject and Reference fields may
be restricted to specified users.

Syntax:   >>APPEND-FILE <draft-file> <field name><CR>
Defaults:                  none         TEXT:

     APPEND-FILE appends the entire contents of a specified
draft-file to the present contents of the specified field.
APPEND-FILE makes it possible to "package" lengthy files into
messages for reporting, publication, or other purposes.

(EXAMPLE exists.)
>>SHOW TO:<CR>
To: SMITH
>>APPEND-FILE ADDRESSLIST TO:<CR>
     The user appends the file ADDRESSLIST which contains
     additional names.
>>SHOW TO:<CR>
To: SMITH
    WASHINGTON, ADAMS, JEFFERSON,
    TINKER, EVERS, CHANCE

Hermes renames an archived parseq file if the corresponding
message-file is still accessible on the computer.

If you have organized the message-file into stored "sequences",
you will find that they are missing when you look at the
message-file again.  the reason is that the "parseq" file stores
both the "parse" or index to the file, which Hermes can
regenerate, and the "sequences" which are created by you, the
user.

If you did not create any sequences, you can ignore the parseq
file.  It doesn't tkae up any of your storage space in your
directory.  If you wish, you can delete it at the @ prompt by
using a subcommand of the TOPS-20 command DELETE.  Type ",<CR>"
instead of "<CR>" at the end of the DELETE command:

>PUSH
@DELETE NAM.ARCHIVED-PARSEQ,<CR>
@@ARCH<ESC>IVED FILES INCLUDED<CR>
@@<CR>
@
>POP<CR>

If you do want to retrieve the old sequences, give the command:

>PUSH<CR>
@RETRIEVE NAME.ARCHIVED-PARSEQ<CR>

and wait for the computer operator to notify you that the file
has been retrieved.  This should take about two hours or so.

When the file has been retrieved:

>COPY NAME.ARCHIVED-PARSEQ ^NAME.TXT^.1<CR> (Superseding)<CR>

Note: You must type a <CTRL-V> character before each of the ^
characters in order to include them in a filename.  You must make
sure that the version number matches the version number of the
message-file, NAME.TXT.1.

It is necessary to use the COPY rather than the RENAME command
because Hermes must write into a parseq file, and any archived
file is "frozen", i.e., protected against any change while its
contents are on line.  At this point, you have no further use for
the archive parseq file, and you might as well delete it.  

A LITTLE NORE BACKGROUND ...

On TOPS-20 host computers, when a file is "archived" or
"migrated", the filename remains in your directory.

If you look at your files with the TOPS-20 operating system
command DIRECTORY, files that have been archived are shown with a
;F or ;OFFLINE marking, e.g.,

@DIRECTORY *NAME*.*<CR>
NAME.TXT.1
^NAME.TXT^.1;OFFLINE

In this case, the message-file, NAME.TXT.1, is on line, i.e., it
has contents on the computer disk, where you can read it, but the
companion, or "parseq" file has been archived.  It exists only as
a filename on the computer, and the contents is stored on
magnetic tape.

In the situation shown here, Hermes needs a "parseq" file, in
order to allow you to read the message-file.  Ordinarily, if the
parseq file does not exist, Hermes constructs a new one.  In this
case, Hermes cannot construct a new parseq file because the name
of the old parseq file exists, although the contents is no longer
on the computer.

WHEN A MESSAGE IS SENT:

The HERMES system automatically creates a Date: field, a Sender:
field, and a Message-ID.

When a message is sent through the ARPAnet, the FTP server, which
is the programm called by the MAILER program, appends a line:

   Mail from <host-name> rcvd at 10-Jan-78 1234

This line is printed by the HERMES template item Other:.

If the message is not sent through MAILER, but is appended
locally by HERMES, the HERMES program creates the "Mail from ..."
line.  If the message is placed in a message-file with an Fcc:
field, the line is altered to read:

   Mail from <host-name> filed at 10-Jan-78 1234


WHEN A MESSAGE IS RECEIVED:

Either MAILER or HERMES automatically appends a machine-readable
header line, of the form:

     21-Feb-79 12:34:56-EST,876;000000000000

The date and time show when the message was placed in the
message-file.  This date changes every time the message is moved
from one file to another with the FILE or MOVE commands.

The number following the comma is the number of characters in the
message, excluding the machine-readable header, and the string of
12 zeroes are digits later used to record information about the
status of the message.

All messages must have a machine-readable header, but the header
is not printed as such by HERMES.

HERMES creates the MESSAGE-ID field from information in the
Sender and the "Mail from ..."  line.  The template item
Rcvd-Date prints the date in the "Mail from ..."  line.  The
template items Filed-Date, Char-Count and Status print
information from the machine-readable header.  If the message has
been created by a message system other than Hermes and not sent
through MAILER, it may lack a "Mail from ..."  line.  If so, the
Rcvd-Date: will change be taken from the machine-readable header,
and will change when messages are moved with the FILE or MOVE
commands.

The Message-No.  template item prints a serial number based on
the position of the message in the message-file.
   All lines in the message that are not part of the Text:
   field.  Also called header fields.
   Date message was sent.
   Connected Directory of Sender of message.
   Login Directory of Sender of message.
   Unique identifier, combining Date and Sender.
   -+ or UNSEEN RECENT; blanks mean SEEN or OLD.
   Position of message in message-file.
   Total no. of characters in message.
   Date message was received.
   Date message was filed with FILE command.

If your UPDATE-PROFILE switch is set to YES, your Active
Environment is automatically saved in your PROFILE when you QUIT,
EXIT or LOGOUT.  The Active Environment consists of your filters,
templates, destinations, user-fields and switch settings.

Note: Your sequences are also saved automatically, but not in
your profile.  Since sequences refer to a specific message-file,
they are saved in the "parseq" or "up-arrow" file associated with
that message-file.  Your sequences are available to anyone who
uses the message-file.  Your profile, on the other hand, is
available only to the person who logs into your directory.

1. HOW TO RESTORE THE DRAFT FROM THE BACKUP FILES.

The procedure for restoring the entire draft is:

>RESTORE $D<ESC>RAFT-BACKUP-APR-9-156PM<CR>

If you have more than one $DRAFT file, hitting the <ESC> key will
cause the filename to print out until the point where the
filenames differ.  At that point, you can type in the date or
time.  You can type ? to see what your choices are.

If the crash occurred when you were in the middle of composing a
field, the field will not appear in the $DRAFT file.  However, if
you were composing a Text: field, you will have the $TEXT field
as backup.  The $TEXT file will always have a more complete
version of the Text: field than the version in the $DRAFT file.
To get back the most complete backup of the Text: field:

>>ERASE Text<CR>		This gets rid of the older version
				from the $DRAFT file.
>>APPEND-FILE $T<ESC>EXT-BACKUP-APR-9-156PM (to field)<ESC> Text:<CR>

or

>>ERASE Text<CR>
Text:<CR>
<CTRL-B>
Input from file: $T<ESC>EXT-BACKUP-APR-9-156PM<CR>

The $DRAFT and $TEXT files will not be affected by the RESTORE,
APPEND-FILE and <CTRL-B> commands, so you can erase the contents
of the DRAFT-EDITOR and repeat any of these commands if you have
any problems.


2. HOW TO DELETE THE BACKUP FILES.

When you no longer need the $DRAFT and $TEXT files, you should
get rid of them.

   a) If your FILENAME-INPUT switch is set to HERMES:

      Both of these files are, of course, DRAFT-FILES.  You can 
      DELETE them through the use of the DRAFT-FILES editor.

   b) If your FILENAME-INPUT switch is set to TENEX or TOPS-20:

      You must use the operating system, at the @ prompt, to 
      delete files.

For examples of how to delete these files, type EXAMPLE<CR>.


3. THE BACK-UP PROCEDURE.

Within two minutes after the time you begin to compose a draft,
HERMES creates a file containing a copy of the draft.  Every two
minutes thereafter, HERMES overwrites this file with the most
recent state of the draft.

The $DRAFT File.  This file contains the entire draft, in the
same form as the files created by the STORE-DRAFT command.  The
file is named after the time that you began your Hermes session.
If you began at 1:56 pm on April 9, the file is shown as
$DRAFT-BACKUP-APR-9-156PM (if your FILENAME-INPUT switch is set
to HERMES) or $DRAFT-BACKUP-APR-9-156PM.HRM;1 (if your
FILENAME-INPUT switch is set to TENEX).  This file is
automatically deleted when you QUIT or LOGOUT from Hermes, at the
> prompt.

The $TEXT File.  This file is named $TEXT-BACKUP-APR-9-156PM.  It
is created when you begin to create a Text: field.  It is deleted
when you finish the Text: field by typing <CTRL-Z>.  If you use
one of the auxiliary editors, NETED, TECO, WE or XED the $TEXT
file is deleted when you leave the auxiliary editor and return to
the >> prompt.

Normally, you are not aware of these files.  However, if the
session ends abnormally, the files remain in your directory, and
the next time you enter HERMES, you will get a notice about them:

     NOTE:  The following backup file exists in directory <USER>:
       $DRAFT-BACKUP-APR-9-156PM
     Type DESCRIBE BACKUP<cr> for more information.


4. BACKGROUND INFORMATION

HERMES automatically provides a back-up for the unsent draft
message.

NOTE: You compose a draft by using the COMPOSE, REPLY or FORWARD
commands, or by typing EDIT<CR> and then typing the names of
fields as commands to to >> prompt.  Every time that you compose
an unsent draft message, you are in the DRAFT-EDITOR.

You now have protection against losing the unsent draft when a
HERMES session ends abnormally because:

   a) The computer crashes, or

   b) Hermes crashes, and cannot continue, or

   c) You get a DETACHED job (lose your connection to the
      computer) and fail to ATTACH properly, or

   d) You end the session with <CTRL-C> and fail to CONTINUE.

There is also a chance that you will get a backup file when you
DON'T need it.  This can happen if you drop into TOPS-20 by
giving the PUSH command.  If you then LOGOUT at the @ prompt,
Hermes does not go through its normal routines as it does when
you LOGOUT at the > prompt.  The result can be an unwanted backup
file.  To avoid this, always QUIT or POP back to the > prompt, 
before you LOGOUT.
a) If your FILENAME-INPUT switch is set to HERMES:

>EDIT DRAFT-FILES<CR>
d->SHOW<CR>
$DRAFT-BACKUP-MAR-30-156PM
$TEXT-BACKUP-MAR-30-156PM
<CTRL-O>^O		Type <CTRL-O> to stop printout of
			all your draft-files.
d->DELETE $D<ESC>RAFT-BACKUP-MAR-30-156PM<CR>
d->DELETE $T<ESC>EXT-BACKUP-MAR-30-156PM<CR>
d->DONE<CR>

b) If your FILENAME-INPUT switch is set to TENEX or TOPS-20:

>EXEC<CR>
@DIRECTORY<CR>
$DRAFT-BACKUP-MAR-30-156PM.HRM;1
$TEXT-BACKUP-MAR-30-156PM.HRM;1
<CTRL-O>^O		Type <CTRL-O> to stop printout of
			all your files.  The extension and version
			are HRM.1 on TOPS-20.

Syntax:       >>Bcc: <addressee-list> <CR>
		
Bcc: is a ADDRESSEE-TYPE field.  When you SEND the draft
message, a copy is transmitted to each name in the Bcc:
field.  However, since Bcc means "blind carbon copies", the
Bcc: field appears only on copies sent to addressees listed
in the Bcc field, and on the copies created by the Fcc:
field, if any.

If there is a GROUPNAME in the Bcc: field, the Groupname
only, and not the list of addressees that follow it, is
transmitted when you SEND the message.

<CR>   Carriage return key.  Ends most HERMES commands.

When the system prints [CONFIRM], you are expected to type <CR>
again to confirm the command. If you decide not to confirm, type
<RUBOUT> to abort the command. (DELETE-key on some terminals.) 

When the system asks a question, such as  "Send?", you are
expected to type Yes<CR> or No<CR>.  In this case, 
Yes<CR> = Y<CR> = <CR> and No<CR> = N<CR>.

When you enter text into a TEXT-type field, or when you enter
template items with the LINE-INSERT subcommand, <CR> is the
ordinary new-line character.

Set your CR-FUNCTION-SWITCH to "Extend" to make <CR> print
command and argument names in full.
	
Syntax:      >>Cc: <addressee-list> <CR>
		
Cc: is a ADDRESSEE-TYPE field.  When you SEND the draft
message, a copy is transmitted to each name in the Cc: field.
The Cc: field appears on all copies of the message.

If there is a GROUPNAME in the Cc: field, the Groupname only,
and not the list of addressees that follow it, is transmitted
when you SEND the message.

The current draft message in the DRAFT-EDITOR.  Only one draft,
the CDRAFT, can exist at one time.
CHANGE has a set of single-character subcommands.  There is no
prompt; the subcommands are not printed, but they cause some
conventional signs to be printed.

Advanced Command (>> prompt):
CHANGE line field numbered/unnumbered
                 Lets you change a line by copying from an
                  "old" version into a "new" version.

Subcommands of CHANGE (no prompt):
  <space>        Copies one character from old line to new.
  n<space>       Copies n characters.
  <CR>           Copies the rest of line and ends CHANGE.
  E              Copies to End of line.
  Sc             Searches for any character c.  Attempts to
                  match case (upper or lower) of c, then
                  searches for the other case. Copies up to c.
  S<space>       Searches for a space; thus copies to the end
                  of the next word.
  nSc            Searches for nth c, then copies up to nth c.
  B              Breaks line into two lines.  (To combine two
                  lines, leave CHANGE and use FORMAT.)
  I              Begins an Insertion.  End with <CR> or
                  <CTRL-Z>.  Rings bell or prints !.
  D              Deletes next character to right.  Prints /.
  nD             Deletes n characters to right.
  <CTRL-A>       TENEX: Deletes character to left. Prints \.
  n<CTRL-A>        "    Deletes n characters to left.
  <CTRL-Q>         "    Deletes line to left.
  <RUBOUT/DEL>   TOPS-20: Deletes character to left. Prints \.
  n<RUBOUT/DEL>    "      Deletes n characters to left.
  <CTRL-U>         "      Deletes line to left.
  <CTRL-W>       Deletes one word to left.  Prints <.
  n<CTRL-W>      Deletes n words to left.
  <CTRL-R>       Retypes line.
  <CTRL-S>       Retypes entire field.

When you use the I subcommand of CHANGE, how should HERMES
signal the beginning and end of the insertion?

     1. Print nothing when you type I, and ring the bell when
        you type <CR> or <CTRL-Z>.

     2. Print ! when you type I and another ! at the end.

     3. Print nothing.

CHANGE-BELL       [X]Bell         !            Nothing


The Char-Count is the total number of characters in a
message.  Divide by 6 to get a rough estimate of the number
of words.

The HERMES Message System uses fifteen "Control Characters",
which have meanings more or less unique to the system.

A number of single-key characters from the standard ASCII
keyboard are also given special meanings.
   Characters that save you when you type something wrong.
   Characters for editing commands and text in fields.
   Characters formed by holding down the CTRL key and typing a
   letter.
   <SPACE>, <CR>, <ESC>, <LF>, <RUBOUT/DELETE>, <TAB>

(Not available on TOPS-20)

Syntax: >CHECK-INBOX <CR>

Check-Inbox lets you check your INBOX, which is the message-
file MESSAGE.TXT;1 in your INBOX directory.  This is useful
when you are working with some other Message-File.

Check-Inbox prints a bulletin telling the number of new
messages, if any, in your INBOX.
(Not available on TOPS-20)

Syntax: >CHECK-PRINTER<CR>

     Check-Printer queries the lineprinter queue in the
<Printer> directory, and prints the message "PRINTING IN
PROGRESS" if the file is being printed or waiting to be
printed.  The message "PRINTING NOT IN PROGRESS" means that
the file is not waiting in the queue, usually because it has
already been printed.

You can print out the lineprinter queue with the command

>DIRECTORY <Printer><CR>

NOTE: The directory "<Printer>" is a TENEX filename.  You must
type in the angle brackets around "Printer".
	
Syntax:      >>Class-Char: <characters> <CR>
		
Class-Char: is a LINE-TYPE field.  It accepts any characters,
and is terminated with a <CR>.

To continue to a another line, type a comma before the <CR>.


At any point, the message just printed, with either PRINT or
LINE-FEED <LF>, is known as the "current message" (called
"CMESSAGE" or "." for short in HERMES).  CMESSAGE initially
points to "the one before the first" RECENT message, i.e.,
thelast of the old messages, if there are any.  This is done so
that the first <LF> will print the first RECENT message.
   Changes CMESSAGE without printing the message.
   CMESSAGE is the default message specification for most 
   commands, such as PRINT, DELETE, FILE, EXPLODE, MARK, etc.
	
At top command level:
Syntax:   >COMMENT <message-no.> <field-name> <CR>
Default:             CMESSAGE        Text:

COMMENT allows you to comment on a message in your message-file
without first using the EXPLODE command.  This command places you
in a new comment-field, whose name is the field-name enclosed in
square brackets.  Square brackets mean that the field is a
text-type field, so you must end with <CTRL-Z>.  The first line
of this field is automatically filled in with the login directory
and the date.

NOTE: You do not have a chance to edit or format the comment-
field, or to modify any of the original fields.  No original
fields are changed.
	
In the DRAFT-EDITOR:
Syntax:   >>COMMENT <field-name> <CR>
Default:                Text:

COMMENT create a comment-field in the DRAFT-EDITOR.  The comment-
field has a first line that contains the login directory and
date.  It can be edited like any other field.

(EXAMPLE exists.)
>COMMENT 5 TO<CR>
(Type comment to ^Z)
[To]: Note by MOOERS on 6 Aug 81 1229-EDT
      This is an example of a comment at top command level.
      I do not have a chance to FORMAT this [To] field.<CTRL-Z>
>EXPLODE 6<CR>
>>COMMENT SUBJECT<CR>
[Subject]: Note by Mooers on 6 Aug 1981 1514-EDT
           This is an example of a comment on a Subject:
           field.  If I had defaulted the field, I would
           have created a [Text] field.
           I can now SEND the message, or I can REFILE it.
           <CTRL-Z>^Z
>>

Syntax:     >COMPOSE <template> <CR>
Defaults:            CTEMPLATE
Initial
Setting:             COMPOSE-FORM

     COMPOSE helps the user create new messages through a series
of prompts.  The initial setting of the CTEMPLATE gives the
prompts To:, Cc:, Subject: and Text:.

     The headers To:, Cc:, and Subject: are all terminated by
carriage return.  To omit one of these fields from the
message, type <CR> as soon as you receive the prompt;  the
system moves on to the next field.  To continue a header on an
additional line, type comma immediately before the final carriage
return.  The Text:-field contains arbitrary text, which may
include <CR>'s, and ends with <CTRL-Z>.

   On completion of the Text: field, COMPOSE requests permission
to send the message.  To grant permission, type YES<CR>.  The
message will be sent and HERMES readied for a new command.  To
deny permission, type NO<CR> and HERMES will shift control to the
DRAFT-EDITOR.  The user is then free to correct mistakes,
review the message, add fields, etc.
>COMPOSE<CR>

     [When you SEND a message, HERMES creates copies for each of
     the addressees, and tells you which ones can be delivered
     immediately.  The copies to JONES and  ROBINSON have been
     queued for another program, named MAILER, which picks them
     up a few minutes later and delivers them.  HERMES does not
     tell you which messages are queued.]

If non-empty fields are present in the draft, should they be
erased before the prompts begin for the COMPOSE, REPLY or FORWARD
commands?

      COMPOSE-ERASE      [X]Ask          Yes          No
      ERASE-BEFORE-REPLY [X]Ask          Yes
      FORWARD-ERASE      [X]Ask          Yes
		

After the COMPOSE, REPLY or FORWARD command has completed
prompting you for the set of fields, should the message
automatically be sent?

      COMPOSE-SEND      [X]Ask           Yes          No
      FORWARD-SEND      [X]Ask           Yes          N0
      REPLY-SEND        [X]Ask           Yes          No

The composing commands, COMPOSE, REPLY and FORWARD, present
the user with a series of prompts for message-fields.  These
prompts are controlled by a template.  Each command defaults
to its own "current template".  The contents of the current
templates can be EDITed or SET to a user-created template.
You can override the current template by typing the name of a
different template after the word COMPOSE, or after the
message specification in REPLY and FORWARD.

          Ex.: >COMPOSE SUGGESTION<CR>
               >REPLY 3 SUGGESTION<CR>

Current:          EDIT contents, or set with SET.
 CTEMPLATE        Default for the COMPOSE command; initially 
                   set to COMPOSE-FORM.
 RTEMPLATE        Default for the REPLY command;  controls
                   prompts for composition; initially set to
                   REPLY-FORM.
 FCTEMPLATE       First default template for the FORWARD
                   command; controls prompts for composition;
                   initially set to FORWARD-COMPOSE-FORM.

User:             CREATE your own user templates.

Fixed:            Fixed templates cannot be EDITed or SET.
 COMPOSE-FORM     Prompts for To, Cc, Subject and Text.
 REPLY-FORM       Prompts for Cc and Text.
 FORWARD-COMPOSE-FORM  Prompts for To, Cc and Subject.
 SUGGESTION       Creates To, Subject and Keywords field; 
                   prepares message to HERMES staff.
 EMPTY-TEMPLATE (=FREE-FORM)
                  Used with COMPOSE to escape from the 
                   CTEMPLATE.
Suppose we have a template named BUGREP to generate bug-reports.

t->SHOW BUGREP<CR>
(1) literal [Subject: BUG REPORT]
(2) "PROGRAM-MAINTAINER:" To:
(3) "PROGRAM-NAME:" Subject:
(4) "NATURE OF TROUBLE" Text:
(5) literal [Text:          REPORTED BY
Text:          T. H. MYER]
(6) literal [Fcc: <MYER>SAVED.MSG]

Note that the content of literal fields is bracketed for  clarity
when  the  template  is  output.   Literals  are considered to be
single items.  Thus template line 5 contains just one  item,  the
literal-Text:  field,  even  though that item occupies 3 physical
lines.

Here's an example of BUGREP in action:

>COMPOSE BUGREP<CR>
Prompted message composition:
SUBJECT: BUG REPORT
PROGRAM-MAINTAINER: JONES@BBNA<CR>
PROGRAM-NAME: FORMAT.SAV<CR>
NATURE OF TROUBLE: PROGRAM FAILS<CR>

        REPORTED BY
        T. H. MYER

1. Responding to [Confirm]

Some commands, such as SEND and ERASE, cause irreversible actions
to take place.  When you terminate such a command with the usual
<CR>, Hermes asks you to confirm by printing "[Confirm]" on your
terminal.  You may:

     a) Confirm with another <CR>, or
     b) Abort the command:
        1) TENEX: Type the RUBOUT or DELETE key.
        2) TOPS-20: Type <CTRL-U>.

2. Responding to Questions, such as "Send?":

     a) Type either Yes<CR> or No<CR> in response to a question.
     b) Type <CR>.  Hermes interprets this as "Yes", but prints 
        "[Confirm]".

  >>SEND <CR>
   [Confirm]<CR>         The message is sent.

  >>SEND<CR>
   [Confirm]<CTRL-U>     The SEND command is aborted on TOPS-20.
                         (Use <RUBOUT/DELETE> on TENEX.)

  >FILE 1:3,5 SAVED<CR>
  Delete messages after filing? Y<CR>
  1:3,5
                         Messages are deleted from your
                         message-file.

  >FILE 1:3,4 SAVED<CR>
  Delete messages after filing? N<CR>
  1:3,5
                         Messages are not deleted.

When you use the EXCHANGE command, should the system require
you to confirm each exchange of the "old string" for the "new
string" by typing <CR> or Y<CR>?

  CONFIRM-EXCHANGES    Ask       [X]Yes          No

To override this switch, type ",<CR>" instead of "<CR>" to end
the EXCHANGE command.  Type ? to +> prompt to see the
override commands.  End override mode by typing <CR> to +>
prompt.
Syntax:    >CONNECT    <directory>  <password> <CR>
Default:             LOGIN directory   none

CONNECT causes HERMES to input draft-files and message-files
from the new connected directory rather than from the login
directory.  This HERMES command is the equivalent of the TENEX
command CONNECT.

An additional feature of the HERMES CONNECT command is that 
typing CONNECT ? causes HERMES to print out a list of all the
directories on the host computer.
   Causes the CONNECTED directory to appear in the From field
   of the outgoing messages.
   Acts on either the login or connected directory.

Syntax:    >CONSIDER  <messages> <CR>
Default:              CSEQUENCE

CONSIDER sets the CSEQUENCE equal to the typed-in message
specification.  This is equivalent to the command:

          >SET CSEQUENCE <messages><CR>
     To type a control character, hold down the key marked
"CONTROL" or "CTRL" and type the letter key.

In the HERMES documentation, control characters are shown as
<CTRL-C> or <CTRL-Z>.  The angle brackets are used to show that
the symbol represents a single character in the computer which
cannot, however, be directly represented by a single printing
character.  When echoed by the computer, control characters
usually appear on the terminal terminal as ^C or ^Z.

1. HOW TO SEND YOURSELF CC COPY OF EVERY MESSAGE YOU SEND

a) Place a literal Cc: field in each of the current templates
   that you normally use to compose messages.
	
        CTEMPLATE       default for the COMPOSE command.
        RTEMPLATE       default for the REPLY command.
        FCTEMPLATE      default for the FORWARD command.
		
   To do this, EDIT each of the current templates, then use the
   LINE-INSERT command to insert a line

        literal CC <addressee>

   with your logged-in directory name as the addressee.

   You may want to COPY your new current template to a new name
   to save it.


b) Set your REPLY-INCLUDEME switch to NO, since you will
   always append a Cc to yourself when you use the REPLY
   command.


2. HOW TO AVOID SENDING ANY CC COPIES TO YOURSELF

a) Set your REPLY-INCLUDEME switch to NO.  Do not place any
   literal Cc fields in your current templates.


3. HOW TO BE SELECTIVE ABOUT IT

a) Set your REPLY-INCLUDEME switch to ASK, and type in Cc's
   for COMPOSE and FOWARD commands.

b) Another approach is to set your REPLY-INCLUDEME switch to NO,
   and create a template with a name like EXTRA.
	
        EXTRA
        (1) literal  [Cc: SMITH]
		
   Set your COMPOSE-ERASE switch to NO, and type the command
   COMPOSE EXTRA after each message for which you want a Cc:
   to yourself.

   This may not save much work if you have only one addressee
   in EXTRA, but it can be a big help if you want to send
   copies to a list of people.

(EXAMPLE exists.)

Default:          none     CSEQUENCE, CFILTER
                           or PTEMPLATE

COPY copies the contents of a named sequence, filter or
template and saves it under a new name.  COPY requires
confirmation with <CR>.

(EXAMPLE exists.)
     >COPY STEMPLATE NEWTHING<CR> [New Object]<CR>

If you specify the name of an existing object, the old 
version will be replaced.

     >COPY MYFILTER OLDFILTER<CR>  [Replace old version] <CR>
   Lets you set the contents of CMESSAGE, CSEQUENCE, CFILTER,
   any current template, FDESTINATION and LDESTINATION.
   COPY does not copy contents into current objects.

If you misspell a Hermes command or object name, for example, if
you type SNED instead of SEND, should Hermes correct
automatically?

     1.  YES.  Correct the spelling and use the corrected
         version in the hermes command.

     2.  NO.  Do not correct the spelling; instead, print "?".

     3.  CONFIRM.  Correct the spelling but print "(Confirm)"
         and require the user to type a <CR>.
 
         NOTE:  The <CR> is not echoed as a carriage-return.

(Example exists.)
In each of these examples, the user single-mindedly typed "SRUV 1:10".

>EDIT SWITCHES

x->DONE
>SRUV(=Survey) 1:10

    1. Recognise: As in older versions of the HERMES system,
       SPACE and <CR> cause recognition of HERMES commands and
       names but do not print anything.

    2. Extend: SPACE and <CR> automatically extend (i.e., print
       in full) HERMES commands and names.

  SPACE-FUNCTION    [X]Recognize    Extend     Noise-Words
  CR-FUNCTION       [X]Recognize    Extend
	
Syntax:     >CREATE  <object-type>  <object> <CR>
Defaults:                DRAFT       CDRAFT
		
CREATE is used to enter an editor and begin constructing a
new object.  You may use the default to enter the
DRAFT-EDITOR; otherwise, you must specify both the
object-type (sequence, filter or template) and the object
name.

(EXAMPLE exists.)
     >CREATE<CR>
     >>

You have entered the DRAFT-EDITOR to create a new
message or return to a message currently in composition.

     >CREATE TEMPLATE ALPHA1<CR>
     t->

You have entered the TEMPLATE-EDITOR and are ready to create
a new template named ALPHA1, or to edit an existing template
named ALPHA1.

CSEQUENCE is the "current sequence", which is the default message
specification for the SURVEY LIST commands.
It is initially set to ALLMESSAGES or "*", the complete set of
message in the current message-file.  As new messages arrive
during a Hermes session, CSEQUENCE is automatically updated.
   Changes the CSEQUENCE to any message specification.
   Changes the current message to the NEXT message in the 
   CSEQUENCE, and then prints it.  Use <LF> and ^ to move back
   and forth in the CSEQUENCE.
(Used on the TENEX Operating System only.)

     <CTRL-A> deletes a single character.  In a message-field
does not delete back across unit parts of an addressee name in
the To:, Cc:, Bcc: or other ADDRESSEE type fields, or a TENEX
file designator in the Fcc:-field.  Echoes as \ followed by the
deleted character.

If you make a mistake in typing one or a few characters, you can
correct your work, one character at a time.
          HES<CTRL-A>\SRMES

In the print-out at your terminal, this appears as
          HES\SRMES

The string that goes to the computer is
          HERMES

Syntax:   <CTRL-B>
          Input from file: <draft-file><CR>
Defaults:                      none

     Typing <CTRL-B> within a message-field has the same effect
as typing the APPEND-FILE subcommand to the >> prompt.  <CTRL-B>
queries the user for a draft-file name, and then appends the file
selected to the current field.

(EXAMPLE exists.)
>>TO: FAITH, HOPE, CHARITY, <CTRL-B>
     The user terminates with CTRL-B.
Input from file: ADDRESSLIST<CR>
     After the HERMES prompt, the user specifies the file which
     contains additional names.
Continue input from:
    TINKER, EVERS, CHANCE
    <CR>
>>SHOW TO <CR>
To: FAITH, HOPE, CHARITY,
    WASHINGTON, ADAMS, JEFFERSON,
    TINKER, EVERS, CHANCE

<CTRL-C> returns you to the TENEX/TOPS-20 command level (prompt
@).  Deleted messages are not expunged.  You can return to HERMES
by typing Continue<CR> to the @ prompt.

<CTRL-C> is safe to use only when HERMES has just issued the
prompt character >, If <CTRL-C> is used at any other time during
the operation of the system, the results of the command that is
being executed cannot be guaranteed.  Two safer commands to use
are Suspend (top-level only) and Exec.

If you are in one of the text editors, NETED, TECO, WE or XED,
or in the SPELL program, <CTRL-C> returns you to HERMES without
change in the draft message, but with loss of the work you have
done in the text editor.  This is a PANIC-BUTTON, in case you get
into an editor by accident and don't know how to get out.

Note: <CTRL-C> does not affect any $DRAFT-BACKUP or $TEXT-BACKUP files
that have been created by Hermes.

(EXAMPLE exists.)
>Exec<CR>
>Create<CR>
>>Exec<CR>
        Allows you to use the TENEX Exec in a "lower fork".
        Return to HERMES by typing Quit to the @ prompt.
>Suspend<CR>
        Equivalent to <CTRL-C> typed to the > prompt at top
        command level.  Returns you to the top Exec.  Continue
        in HERMES by typing Continue to the @ prompt.

Inside a TEXT field, either <CTRL-S> or <CTRL-D> reprints the
text that has been typed in since the last subcommand.

If your scope terminal is set to "terminal page mode"*, <CTRL-S>
does not work on the TOPS-20 Operating System.
scope terminal is set to "terminal page" mode.*

* Note: To set your scope terminal to "terminal page" mode, use
  the TOPS-20 Operating System command:
      @TERMINAL PAGE <n><CR>
  In "terminal page" mode, the scope freezes after <n> lines have
  been displayed.  The control characters, <CTRL-S> and <CTRL-Q>
  are pre-empted by the operating system to act as controls to
  freeze and release the display on the scope, and so they are
  not passed on to the HERMES system.

<CTRL-E> is the Hermes interrupt character; it aborts the current
HERMES command and returns you to the level where you were when
you gave the command.

If you are creating a message-field, HERMES queries you to
prevent accidental loss of a message-field.

(EXAMPLE exists.)
>Compose<CR>
To: Smith<CTRL-E>
Control-E typed.
Abort input of addressees? Y<CR>
^E
>
        You are back at top command level.  But if you type
>Create<CR>
>>Compose<CR>
To: Smith<CTRL-E>
Control-E typed.
Abort input of addressees? Y<CR>
^E
>>
        You are still in the DRAFT-EDITOR.

<CTRL-I> is used to switch off and on the action of the Format
command on a field containing text, typically the Text:-field.

A single <CTRL-I> alone on a line that contains no other
characters (that is, <CR><CTRL-I><CR>) turns OFF the Formatter.

Two <CTRL-I>s on a line (that is, <CR><CTRL-I><CTRL-I><CR>) turns
ON the formatter.

In Formatted text, a <CTRL-I> at the beginning of a paragraph
becomes an indentation of 8 spaces.  Elsewhere, <CTRL-I> acts as
a word separator, like a space.

In un-Formatted text, <CTRL-I> tabulates text, with tab stops at
8, 16, 24, 32, etc., units from the left margin.

The <CTRL-I> character is the same as the <TAB>, the character
produced by typing the TAB key.

In a LINE-type or TEXT-type field, <CTRL-K> calls the editor
specified in the EDITOR-DEFAULT switch, and places any
contents of the message-field in the editor buffer so that
you can begin editing.

The formfeed, or new page, character is CTRL-L.  It is
generated by the "Separate:" template item, and at some
places in the output of the DOCUMENT command.

In all versions of Hermes through 4.1.3, whenever a Hermes
command was sent to the Terminal or TTY: destination, Hermes
would indicate CTRL-L by printing "^L".

In Hermes 4.1.5, at the request of users who have terminals
with mechanical formfeeds, the CTRL-L is no longer blocked,
but is passed through to the terminal, in the form controlled
by the terminal characteristics set in the TENEX/TOPS-20
operating system.

At the same time, Hermes has also been made transparent to
the "tab", CTRL-I.

<CTRL-O> stops print-out of text anywhere in the system.  The
command finishes its operation as if no interrupt had occurred.
Echoes as ^O.

<CTRL-O> is not equivalent to <CTRL-E>. If you interrupt the
print-out of a message with <CTRL-O>, the message is marked SEEN.
If you interrupt with <CTRL-E>, the message is not marked SEEN.

<CTRL-P> enters the PREVIOUSSEQUENCE as a literal sequence, and
as a complete sequence argument, and prints out the message-nos.
in the PREVIOUSSEQUENCE.  The Show and Copy commands do not
accept literal, typed-in sequences or filters.  Since <CTRL-P>
inserts a literal sequence, it cannot be used with Show and Copy.

(EXAMPLE exists.)
>Survey From: Smith<CR>
[HERMES prints a survey of all messages from Smith.]
>Show PREVIOUSSEQUENCE<CR>
3,7,14:16,23,57
>List <CTRL-P>3,7,14:16,23,57<CR>
[HERMES lists 3,7,14:16,23,57.]

<CTRL-Q> deletes a line inside a LINE, TEXT, ADDR or FILE field.
At the beginning of a line, <CTRL-Q> deletes the previous line.
Echoes as _ and a new line.

<CTRL-Q> deletes a complete command line, and aborts the command
before the final <CR>.  When HERMES prints [CONFIRM], type
<CTRL-Q> to abort.  Echoes as XXX and a new line.

<CTRL-Q> has the same function in a command line as <RUBOUT> on
TENEX or <CTRL-U> on TOPS-20.

<CTRL-Q> does not work on the TOPS-20 if your scope terminal is
set to "terminal page" mode.*

* NOTE: To set your scope terminal to "terminal page" mode, use
  the TOPS-20 Operating System command:
      @TERMINAL PAGE <n><CR>
  In "terminal page" mode, the scope freezes after <n> lines have
  been displayed.  The control characters, <CTRL-S> and <CTRL-Q>
  are pre-empted by the operating system to act as controls to
  freeze and release the display on the scope, and so they are
  not passed on to the HERMES system.

<CTRL-R> reprints the current line.

Inside a TEXT field, either <CTRL-S> or <CTRL-D> reprints the
text that has been typed in since the last subcommand.

If your scope terminal is set to "terminal page mode"*, <CTRL-S>
does not work on the TOPS-20 Operating System.
scope terminal is set to "terminal page" mode.*

* Note: To set your scope terminal to "terminal page" mode, use
  the TOPS-20 Operating System command:
      @TERMINAL PAGE <n><CR>
  In "terminal page" mode, the scope freezes after <n> lines have
  been displayed.  The control characters, <CTRL-S> and <CTRL-Q>
  are pre-empted by the operating system to act as controls to
  freeze and release the display on the scope, and so they are
  not passed on to the HERMES system.

Operating system interrupt.  Prints information about the
status of your program (i.e., whether or not it is running),
the load average of the system, and the amount of CPU and real
time you have used.  

In the TOPS-20 Operating System Only:

<CTRL-U> aborts a command before the final <CR>.  When HERMES
prints [CONFIRM], type <CTRL-U> to abort.  Echoes as XXX and a
new line.

<CTRL-U> has the same effect as <CTRL-Q> in a command line.

<CTRL-U> has no effect inside a message-field.
   CTRL-Q pre-empted by TOPS-20 in "terminal page" mode.

<CTRL-V> preceding a character causes the character to be entered
into a text string and not to have any control effect.  Does not
work with the interrupt characters <CTRL-C>, <CTRL-E> and
<CTRL-O>.

(EXAMPLE exists.)
If you are typing a Text:-field, <CTRL-Z> terminates
the field.  <CTRL-V><CTRL-Z> causes the <CTRL-Z> to be entered as
part of the text string, where it is shown as ^Z.

In a LINE-type or TEXT-type field, <CTRL-W> deletes a single word.
Echo as < followed by the first letter of the deleted word.
Otherwise, acts like <CTRL-Q>.
(Used in TECO on the TOPS-20 Operating System only)

In the TECO editor, <CTRL-X> aborts a command and returns you
to the * prompt.

<CTRL-Y> calls a program that allows you to lock your terminal
without logging out.
         KEY TO UNLOCK CONSOLE IS: <key><CR>
         PASSWORD: <user's password><CR>

Your terminal in now locked, and will not transmit any characters
to the computer.  To unlock the terminal, type <key>.

You can abort the program after <CTRL-Y> and before <CR>:
     On TENEX, type <RUBOUT> or <CTRL-Q>.
     On TOPS-20, type <CTRL-U> or <CTRL-Q>.

If the key does not work the first time you try it, there are
probably extra characters in the buffer, typed while the terminal
was locked.  Type <RUBOUT> (on TENEX) or <CTRL-U> (on TOPS-20)
and try again.

If you forget the <key>, you must go to another terminal, log in
under another job number, and then log out the job attached to
the locked terminal.

(EXAMPLE exists.)
Smith, whose password is WUGGSYM locks his terminal:
><CTRL-Y>
KEY TO UNLOCK CONSOLE IS: MAGIC<CR>
PASSWORD WUGGSYM<CR>            "MAGIC" and "WUGGSYM" do not echo.

The terminal is now locked until "MAGIC" is typed again.

<CTRL-Z> ends a TEXT field or the Line-Insert subcommand in the
TEMPLATE-EDITOR.  Echoes as ^Z.  (TELNET USERS: Change your
escape character from <CTRL-Z> to something else before you use
HERMES.)

The HERMES defaults, known as "current objects", include the
CSEQUENCE, the CFILTER and the default templates STEMPLATE,
PTEMPLATE, LTEMPLATE, CTEMPLATE, RTEMPLATE, FCTEMPLATE,
FITEMPLATE and ITEMPLATE.

These can neither be created nor destroyed, but you can
change their contents by using the SET and EDIT commands.
There will always be an STEMPLATE, but you can give it any
form you wish.

The "collective objects", CDRAFT, DRAFT-FILES, MESSAGE-FILES,
RECORD-OF-MESSAGE-FILES, SWITCHES, and USER-FIELDS and the
PROFILE, are also treated as current objects.  You may change
their contents but you may not erase their names.

(EXAMPLE exists.)
     >EDIT CSEQUENCE<CR>
     s->

You are in the SEQUENCE-EDITOR.

     >CREATE SEQUENCE CSEQUENCE<CR> [EDIT old version] <CR>
     s->

You are in the SEQUENCE-EDITOR.
   Lets you set the contents of CMESSAGE, CSEQUENCE, CFILTER,
   any current template, FDESTINATION and LDESTINATION.
One-letter synonym for DELETE.

The Date: field is created when the message is SENT.  It contains
the date and time, in hours and minutes, that the message was SENT.

     Date: 10 Feb 1978 1215-EDT

When messages are SORTed by Date:, the time is ignored.

The SURVEY-FORM template contains the Rcvd-Date: field, rather
than the Date: field, to avoid including the time on the Survey
line.
  Date that message was received.
	
Syntax:     >><name>-(DATE) <date>  <CR>
		
A date field may contain only a single date.  A <CR>
terminates the field.  The date is stored in its typed-in
format.

You may enter the date as Today, Yesterday, or almost any
reasonable form of the date, such as 13 OCT 1978, 13-OCT-78,
October 13, 1978, or 10/13/78.

(EXAMPLE exists.)
>>BICENTENNIAL-(DATE): July 4, 1976<CR>

Filters can check for a specific date or a range of dates in any
of the date fields.

(EXAMPLE exists.)
This rather complex specification selects messages sent in
the date range shown; then rejects those with an END-DATE
before 5/1/76; and finally selects from the remainder those
with today's date in the suspense field.
	
     f->REQUIRE DATE: AFTER: 3/12/76 BEFORE: 4 JUL 76<CR>
     f->REJECT END-DATE: BEFORE: 5/1/76<CR>
     f->REQUIRE SUSPENSE-DATE: ON: TODAY<CR>
		
Note, however, one restriction--BEFORE and AFTER can both
appear in a date criterion, even though the range may be
empty and meaningless (BEFORE: YESTERDAY AFTER: TODAY).
However, ON cannot appear with either BEFORE or AFTER.

In the special case where one REQUIRES a range or date based
on the DATE: field, the words REQUIRE and DATE: can be
omitted.  Thus, the first line above could have been
abbreviated:

     f->AFTER: 3/12/76 BEFORE: 4 JUL 76<CR>

The DECODE command has been changed to DECRYPT.

Syntax:         >> DECRYPT  <CR>

DECRYPT operates only on the Text: field.

If the Text: field in the DRAFT-EDITOR contains text encrypted
with the Hermes ENCRYPT command, Hermes prompts you for a
"key".  Like your password, the key does not print.

     1) If you type the correct key, Hermes replaces the 
        contents of the Text: field with the decrypted text.

     2) If you type an incorrect key, Hermes informs you that
        the Key is incorrect, and prompts for the key again.

     3) If you type a carriage-return, Hermes returns you to
        the >> prompt without decrypting the Text: field.

If you have previously established a default key, through the
use of the ENCRYPT or DECRYPT commands or any other command
that prompts for a key, you may type <ESC> to enter the
default key.

(Example exists.)
>EDIT MESSAGE 8

  Command for encrypting a Text: field in the DRAFT-EDITOR.
   Printing commands that include Text: field, also EDIT 
   MESSAGE and EXPLODE, prompt for the key.  Hit a <CR> if
   you don't know the key; hit <ESC> for the default key.
   Synonym for ENCRYPT
   Synonym for DECRYPT

All printing commands that include the Text: field
automatically prompt you for the "key" when the Text: field
has been encoded by Hermes.  Like your password, the key does
not print.

The printing commands are <LF>, ^, PRINT, LIST and even
SURVEY, if SURVEY is used with a template that prints the
Text: field.  The EDIT MESSAGE and EXPLODE commands also
prompt for the key.

     1) If you type the correct key, Hermes replaces the 
        contents of the Text: field with the decrypted text.

     2) If you type an incorrect key, Hermes informs you that
        the Key is incorrect, and prompts for the key again.

     3) If you type a carriage-return, Hermes returns you to
        the >> prompt without decrypting the Text: field.

If you have previously established a default key, through the
use of any of the commands that prompt for a key, you may
type <ESC> to enter the default key.

   Command for encrypting a Text: field in the DRAFT-EDITOR.
   Command for decrypting a Text: field in the DRAFT-EDITOR.

The DEFAULTS line in a DESCRIBE topic specifies the value
that the command assumes if you do not type in additional
arguments.

The CURRENT-OBJECTS, such as CMESSAGE, CSEQUENCE or PTEMPLATE,
are default settings for HERMES commands such as DELETE or PRINT.
To see the default arguments for a command, type <ESC>
repeatedly until the bell rings on your terminal.

>PRINT (messages) 10 (using template) PTEMPLATE (on file) TTY:
  ...r-r-ring!
or
>SURVEY (messages) CSEQUENCE (on file) TTY:  ...r-r-ring!

(EXAMPLE exists.)
Syntax:   PRINT  <messages>  <template>  <destination> <CR>
Defaults:        <cmessage>    PTEMPLATE        TTY:

     This denotes that for the PRINT command, the default for the
     first argument is the CMESSAGE.  Since this a single number,
     the message-no. is printed out.  The default for the second
     argument is PTEMPLATE, and for the third, TTY:.

At top command level:

Syntax:   >DELETE  <messages>  <CR>
Default:            CMESSAGE

DELETE marks a message DELETED.  The message remains in the file,
but you cannot print it with the PRINT or LIST commands.

You can SURVEY deleted messages, but only if all the messages
specified in the SURVEY command are deleted.  If you survey a
mixed group of deleted and undeleted messages, Hermes will simply
show the message-numbers of the deleted ones.  (See the example
for this topic.)

You can UNDELETE a DELETED message.

The DELETED status is normally a stage in getting rid of unwanted
messages.  If you give the EXPUNGE command, or if you answer yes
when Hermes asks Expunge?, all DELETED messages are physically
removed from the message-file.  The EXPUNGE-RENUMBER switch
allows you to choose whether the remaining messages are to be
renumbered or not.

    *          *           *           *          *          *

In the DRAFT-FILES-EDITOR or MESSAGE-FILES-EDITOR, d-> or m-> prompt:

Syntax:        DELETE <file-name> <CR>
Default:                 none

The DELETE subcommand marks the entire file to be removed from your
file storage space.  Once you have left the editor with the DONE
subcommand, the file is expunged, and cannot be UNDELETED.

   One-letter synonym for DELETE
   Permanently removes DELETED messages.
   Determines whether EXPUNGE renumbers remaining messages.
   These switches can be individually set so that messages
   are automatically deleted when they are FILEd or MOVEd.
DEPTH determines the amount of detail output by the
documentation-commands.  It can range in value from 1 to ALL.
The larger the value, the more layers of topics in the
OUTLINE are included.

Syntax:   DESCRIBE     <topic>       <depth>  <destination>  <CR>
Defaults:         INTRODUCING-HERMES*   1         TTY:

The DESCRIBE command outputs information about any HERMES
topic to a destination.  The information typically consist of:

     1) Relevant syntax.
     2) Relevant defaults.
     3) A brief paragraph describing the topic.
        This paragraph will usually contain words which
        are unknown to the naive user.  Most of these are
        available as topics and can be interrogated
        using DESCRIBE.
     4) A list of other related topics.  The related topics
        are numbered so you can substitute the topic number
        for the topic name in a subsequent DESCRIBE command.

* NOTE: In the DRAFT-EDITOR and other editors, <topic> defaults
  to different topics, appropriate to the editor.

(EXAMPLE exists.)
>DESCRIBE INTRODUCING-HERMES
     Presents a brief introduction to HERMES on your terminal.
>DESCRIBE PRINT
     Presents a brief description of PRINT on your terminal.
>DESCRIBE INTRODUCING-HERMES 9 LPT:
     Presents a description of HERMES and descriptions for nine
     levels of subtopics. Because the user specified LPT:, the
     description will be printed on the line-printer.
The place where the output of a command is printed or filed in
the "destination".  The settings of the two current objects,
FDESTINATION and LDESTINATION, are stored in the PROFILE.

You can override the default destination, by typing in another
destination, e.g., TTY:, LPT: or a file-name.

The TTY: and LPT: are treated like files when they are used as
output devices.  This is why the destination part of a command is
introduced by the noise words "(on file)".  The destination is
always the last part of the command; in printing commands, it
comes after both the message specification and the template,
because it is the part most often defaulted.

          Ex.: >PRINT 100:150 STEMPLATE SURVEY-FILE<CR>
               >LIST 1:20 LTEMPLATE TTY:<CR>

Current:          Set contents with SET.
 FDESTINATION     Default for the FILE and MOVE command;
                   initially set to [None]; may be set to any
                   file-name but not to TTY: or LPT:.
 LDESTINATION     Default for the LIST and DOCUMENT commands;
                   initially set to LPT:.

Possible Destinations:
 TTY:             Also TERMINAL if the FILENAME-INPUT switch
                   is set to HERMES.  The user's terminal.
                   Default for PRINT, SURVEY, HOW, HELP, NEWS,
                   OUTLINE, DESCRIBE and EXAMPLE.
 LPT:             Also LINE-PRINTER if the FILENAME-INPUT switch
                   is set to HERMES.  The line-printer physically
                   located at the host computer.
 file-name        Appends to any message-file for FILE and MOVE.
                   Appends to any draft-file for PRINT, SURVEY,
                   SHOW, HELP. NEWS, OUTLINE, DESCRIBE, and 
                   EXAMPLE.  Overwrites any draft-file for 
                   SAVE-FIELD and STORE-DRAFT.
>SURVEY RECENT STEMPLATE LINE-PRINTER<CR>
     A survey of all recent messages, in the form specified by
     the STEMPLATE, is generated on the line printer.

>LIST ALPHA/BETA GAMMA REPORT<CR> [New File]<CR>
     All messages in sequence ALPHA, meeting the specifications
     of filter BETA are output through template GAMMA onto
     data-file REPORT.
   When your terminal has mechanical formfeeds, and the TENEX
   or TOPS-20 terminal characters are set correctly, Hermes
   allows CTRL-L to cause the termimal to space to the top of
   a new page.
   Beginning with HERMES 4.1.12, Fcc fields are stored
   without version numbers in Fcc fields and in FDESTINATION
   and LDESTINATION.
See News for March 1980.
(Not available on TOPS-20)

Syntax:    >DIRECTORY <file-list><CR>
Defaults:             <USER>*.*;*

     Directory prints on your terminal the names of the files in
<file-list>, where file-list is one or more TENEX file
designations, separated by commas.

The default prints a list of all files in your directory.

>Directory <Printer><CR> prints the lineprinter queue.

     NOTE: The directory "<Printer>" is a TENEX file designation.
     You must type in the angle brackets around "Printer".

Syntax:   DOCUMENT     <topic>      <depth>  <destination>  <CR>
Defaults:         INTRODUCING-HERMES   2     LDESTINATION

The DOCUMENT command is intended to provide users with printed
documentation about any HERMES topic.  It combines the effects of
OUTLINE, DESCRIBE and EXAMPLE.  The topic is first outlined to
the specified depth, and then for each topic in the outline, a
description and examples are output.  The initial setting of the
LDESTINATION is the LPT: or LINE-PRINTER.

* NOTE: In the DRAFT-EDITOR and other editors, <topic> defaults
  to different topics, appropriate to the editor.

(EXAMPLE exists.)
>DOCUMENT INTRODUCING-HERMES 2<CR>
     Prints an introductory set of a dozen topics, each less than
     two pages long, that cover the basic HERMES commands and
     features.
>DOCUMENT INTRODUCING-HERMES ALL<CR>
     Prints a complete (and consequently long) document,
     consisting of nearly 300 topics.  These contain a good deal
     of repetition because they are designed to be read separately.
>DOCUMENT TEMPLATE 1 TTY:<CR>
     Has the same effect as:
          >OUTLINE TEMPLATE 1<CR>
          >DESCRIBE TEMPLATE<CR>
          >EXAMPLE TEMPLATE<CR>

Basic Commands (> prompt):
HELP        dst       Helps you get started, basic commands.
NEWS        dst       News of latest changes.
STATUS      ---       Shows login and connected directories, 
                       and the current message-file.

   Escape key causes Hermes to print out completely any word
   you have typed, then print words in parentheses to introduce
   the next part of the command.  Typing <ESC> again inserts the
   "default".  Most commands have defaults useful to the beginner.
   At any point, even within a word, typing ? causes Hermes
   to print all possible choices on your terminal.

Use <ESC> and ? freely.  They help you find your way around Hermes.

Syntax:    DONE<CR>

DONE terminates the editing session and carries out all of
the changes made during the session.

In the DRAFT-EDITOR, DONE terminates the session and
returns to the top level without SENDing the message.  Message
fields currently in the editor become accessible again when the
editor is re-entered with CREATE or EDIT.

Should certain potentially destructive commands, such as ERASE
and SEND, require double confirmation (two <CR>s)?

  DOUBLE-CONFIRM    [X]Yes          No


The Current draft, CDRAFT, is a Hermes object which is an unsent
message, consisting of a collection of fields.  Only one draft
exists at one time.  You can create the draft with the top-level
commands COMPOSE, REPLY or FORWARD.  HERMES prompts you for the
required fields.  If you do not SEND the draft, you are placed in
the DRAFT editor (>> prompt).

Basic Commands (>> prompt):
ABORT                 Erases the draft and return to top level.
DONE                  Does not erase.  Returns to top level.
SEND                  Distributes draft as a message to addressees
                       in To:, Cc: and Bcc:, and to files in Fcc:.
Advanced Commands (>> prompt):
INCLUDE   msg         Copies messages into the text of the draft.
EXPLODE   msg-no.     Turns a message into the draft.  The EDIT
                       MESSAGE command is not available at >>.
REFILE    msg-no.     Turns the draft into a message in the 
                       current message-file, either as a
                       specified message-no. or a new message
                       Defaults to the message-no. last used
                       in EDIT MESSAGE (or EXPLODE) command.
                       Erases draft.  Returns to top level.
SAVE-FIELD field file Creates a draft-file from a field.
                       (Overwrites; default: Text:)

DRAFT-FILES are files that contain

  a) Text or address-lists which can be inserted into fields
     of drafts with APPEND-FILE or <CTRL-B>.  Create these
     draft-files with the SAVE-FIELD command.

  b) Entire drafts, which can be inserted into the draft with
     RESTORE-DRAFT.  Create these draft-files with the 
     STORE-DRAFT command.

If your FILENAME-INPUT switch is set to HERMES --

  1) All file-names are displayed as single words, e.g.
     CANNED-TEXT or ADDR-LIST-1.  These names may contain 
     upper-case letters, numbers or -.

  2) The command SHOW DRAFT-FILES displays a list of all the
     DRAFT-FILES in your directory.  Or type APPEND-FILE ?
     or <CTRL-B> and then ?

  3) You can get rid of files by using the DELETE command in
     the DRAFT-FILES editor.  Type EDIT DRAFT-FILES.

  4) With Hermes filenames, SAVE-FIELD and STORE-DRAFT overwrite,
     i.e., destroy the previous contents of the file.

If your FILENAME-INPUT switch is set to TENEX or TOPS-20 --

  1) All filenames are displayed in the operating system form,
     e.g., ADDR-LIST-1.HRM;1 on TENEX or ADDR-LIST-1.HRM.1 on
      TOPS-20.

  2) On TENEX, you may use the DIRECTORY command at either the >
     or @ prompt to show all the files in your directory; on
     TOPS-20, DIRECTORY is available only at the @ prompt.

  3) You must use the TENEX/TOPS-20 DELETE command at the @
     prompt to get rid of files.

The name of a file in any directory other than your connected
directory consists of the name of the directory, enclosed in
angle brackets, followed by the name of the file:
     <JONES>CANNED-TEXT for HERMES file-names
     <JONES>CANNED-TEXT.HRM;1 for TENEX file-names
     <JONES>CANNED-TEXT.HRM.1 for TOPS-20 file-names

If the FILENAME-INPUT switch is set to HERMES, you can delete
message-files and draft-files from within Hermes.  If the switch
is set to TENEX or TOP-20, you must PUSH to the @ prompt and use
the TENEX/TOPS-20 command DELETE.

The MESSAGE-FILES editor displays message-files only but deletes
both message-files and their companion parseq files.  The DRAFT-
FILES editor displays draft-files only.

To display any other files in your directory, PUSH to the @
prompt and use the TENEX/TOPS-20 command DIRECTORY.

Commands (> prompt):
EDIT MESSAGE-FILES  Enters the MESSAGE-FILES editor.
EDIT DRAFT-FILES    Enters the DRAFT-FILES editor.

Subcommands (m-> or d-> prompt):
ABORT               Aborts deletions.  Returns to >.
DONE                Permanently deletes and expunges files.
                     Returns to >.
DELETE   file       Marks file to be deleted.
UNDELETE file       Removes marks for deletion.
SHOW                Shows list of files.

Syntax:    >EDIT    <object>  <CR>
Defaults:            CDRAFT

EDIT is used to enter an editor and change an existing object.
You may use the default to enter the DRAFT-EDITOR, or you may
type the name of an object.  The system automatically calls the
appropriate editor.

Objects are:
     Any existing sequence, filter or template
     SWITCHES
     USER-FIELDS
     MESSAGE-FILES
     RECORD-OF-MESSAGE-FILES
     DRAFT-FILES
     PROFILE

In the DRAFT-EDITOR:
Syntax:      >>EDIT <CR>

EDIT calls the text editor specified by the EDITOR-DEFAULT switch
and places the contents of the Text: field in the buffer of the
editor.  Editors that can be run from with Hermes are:
     TECO
     NETED
     XED
     WE
 
(EXAMPLE exists.)
>EDIT<CR>
>>
     You have entered the DRAFT-EDITOR to create a new
     message or return to a message currently in composition.

>EDIT ALPHA1<CR>
t->
     You have entered the TEMPLATE-EDITOR to edit an existing
     template named ALPHA1.

>EDIT SWITCHES<CR>
x->
     You have entered the SWITCHES-EDITOR to change the settings
     of your switches.

Syntax:     >EDIT MESSAGE <message-no.> <CR>
Default:                    CMESSAGE

EDIT MESSAGE places an incoming message in the draft in the
DRAFT-EDITOR for further editing.

a) EDIT MESSAGE (or EXPLODE) preserves all fields in the
   original message.  All fields are editable, except for the
   Other:  field, and that field is preserved across an EDIT
   MESSAGE/REFILE even though it cannot be created in the DRAFT
   EDITOR or edited there.

b) No new fields are supplied when a message is REFILED.  If the
   draft does not contain a Sender or Date field, none will be
   added.  If the draft contains a Date field, that date will be
   placed in the refiled message with no modification at all.

   If you wish REFILE to tell you when the message was last
   edited either (1) change the Date field with, for example, the
   command

   >Date Today<CR>

   or (2) create a new user-field, such as Last-(Date), and fill
   it in.  There is no automatic way to add today's date when you
   REFILE.

c) If an EDITed (or EXPLODEd) message is placed in the
   DRAFT-EDITOR and then SENT, the Sender, Date and Message-ID
   are erased and HERMES supplies a new set, as occurred in
   versions of HERMES before 4.1.8.  SENDing a message with a
   file-name in the Fcc: field is an alternative to REFILE.

   If you SEND a message which has a non-empty FROM field
   originally supplied by an EDIT MESSAGE (or EXPLODE) command
   and not altered by you, and if this From field does not match
   either your login or connected directory, HERMES queries you:

      "From field is unaltered from exploded message.
      Send anyway?"
   Synonym for EDIT MESSAGE.  EXPLODE also exists in the
   DRAFT-EDITOR, and EDIT MESSAGE does not.

<CTRL-I>     Inside a field, inserts a tab.  Tab stops are set
              every 8 spaces.  One tab alone on a line turns
              OFF FORMAT.  Two tabs alone turn it ON.
<CTRL-B>     Inside a field, inserts the contents of a file.
              Prompts for file-name.

     >>Teco Subject<CR>

The EDITOR interface to the current draft (CDRAFT) puts the whole
draft into one of the auxiliary editors and lets you move the
cursor from field to field.  This is especially useful for
screen-oriented editors such as EMACS.

More information can be found in the file on your host computer:

     <HERMES>WHOLEDRAFT-HERMES.DOC

KNOWN BUG: If you explode a message and edit it in the EDITOR
interface style, Hermes "forgets" the message-number.

EMACS is an editor, available as a subcommand of the HERMES
draft-editor.

NOTE: If you get into EMACS by mistake, <CTRL-C> will get you
back to the HERMES >> without loss.

The command EMACS causes Hermes to create an "inferior fork"
containing a copy of the program EMACS; that is, a copy of EMACS
is made "inside" HERMES, with the specified field of the message
in the EMACS buffer.  You may then use all of the available EMACS
commands to edit the field.

Return to HERMES with the results of your edit by typing

        <CTRL-X> <CTRL-Z>

The effect is that you are returned to the DRAFT-EDITOR with the
results of the edit in the appropriate field.

To abandon the edit and return to the draft editor with no
effect, type the EMACS command <CTRL-C>.

As with other editors, we assume you know how to use EMACS before
you invoke this command.  (See <EMACS>EMACS.GUIDE for
documentation.)

If you have a personal EMACS.INIT file, you may have to make some
changes.  For more information, type

>>EXAMPLE EMACS<CR>

or, if you have just typed DESCRIBE EMACS, type

>>EXAMPLE<CR>

(Example exists.)
In order for the result of the edit to be passed properly to
Hermes, the file name that the buffer is associated with must not
be changed (e.g., by using <CTRL-X> <CTRL-W>).  Further, the
buffer *HERMES* must still exist on conclusion of the edit.

EMACS must be customized for its interface to Hermes by loading a
special EMACS library for Hermes.  If you do not have your
personal EMACS.INIT file, this library is loaded automatically
and you may ignore the remainder of this write-up.

If you have an EMACS.INIT and it ends by loading the system
initialization file, as with the line
	
                 er<EMACS>EMACS.INIT$ @y :m(hfx*)
	
you again have no problem and may ignore the remainder of this
write-up.

If your EMACS.INIT file does not use the system initialization
you must add to your file instructions to determine if EMACS was
loaded from Hermes and, if so, to load the Hermes library.  To
accomplish this effect, add the following to your own EMACS.INIT
file, near the end (that is, after all your normal setup)
	
       fsJName$:f6[j
       f[DFile$
       f~jHERMES$"E f=$Editor Type$[Hermes]$"N 
	     1,m(m.m & Get Library Pointer$)HERMES$"E
		m(m.m Load Library$)HERMES$''
	  ^\'
	
Each "$" in this message is dollar-sign and must be replaced by
an Altmode in the file; likewise, "^\" must be replaced by
Control-\ (octal 034).  These commands terminate execution of the
file and should go after all required customization.  Any special
customization for Hermes should go just before the "^\".

For additional information on EMACS.INIT files, use the EMACS
"Info" subsystem to look in file <INFO>CONV.INFO; e.g., by using

        M-X Info$emacs internals

The HERMES library, which contains the smarts needed to interface
EMACS properly to Hermes, must be loaded.  It processes the CCL
JFN which is passed in AC1 by Hermes, and it also installs an
exit hook which will save the file before exiting.  This latter
works properly only if the *Hermes* still exists.
	

The ENCODE command has been changed to ENCRYPT.

Syntax:         >> ENCRYPT  <CR>

ENCRYPT operates on the Text: field only.

After the Text: field is completed, but before the draft
message is sent, use the ENCRYPT command to perform
encryption.

Note: The Hermes encryption technique is not approved for the
      transmission of classified text.  (A warning is shown
      during the first and second ENCRYPT commands in each
      Hermes session.)  However, the Hermes algorithm has 
      been approved by the National Security Agency for the
      transmission of commercial data.

Hermes prompts you to type a "key", which may be any string
of letters, numbers, punctuation and spaces, ending with a
carriage-return.  (The key makes no distinction between upper
and lower case letters.)  The key does not echo; therefore,
Hermes prompts you to repeat to key for verification.

You may SHOW the draft to see the message in its encrypted
form.

Default keys: Once you have used a key in an ENCRYPT or DECRYPT
command, you may continue to use it as the default key by
typing <ESC> whenever Hermes prompts for a key or a
verification.

The default key disappears when you leave the DRAFT-EDITOR or
at the end of the Hermes session.

>>SEND<CR>
>
   Command for decrypting a Text: field in the DRAFT-EDITOR.
   Printing commands that include Text: field, also EDIT 
   MESSAGE and EXPLODE, prompt for the key.   Hit a <CR> if
   you don't know the key; hit <ESC> for the default key.
   Synonym for ENCRYPT.
   Synonym for DECRYPT.

You may perform encryption on the Text: field only of a draft
message by typing the command ENCRYPT to the >> prompt.

Hermes prompts you for an encryption "key".  The "key" may be
any string of letters, numbers, punctuation and spaces,
ending with a carriage-return.  (The key makes no distinction
between upper and lower case letters.)  Like your password,
the key does not print.

In the ENCRYPT command, you are required to verify the key by
typing it twice.  Once you have used a key for encrypting or
decrypting, it becomes the default key for the rest of the
Hermes session, and you may enter it by hitting the ESCAPE,
<ESC>.

Messages may be decrypted through the use of any printing
command that prints the Text: field (e.g., PRINT or <LF>).
EDIT MESSAGE and EXPLODE, which place a received message in
the DRAFT-EDITOR, also prompt for the key.

The correct key decrypts the message.  The wrong key causes
Hermes to prompt again for the key.  Typing a carriage-return
leaves the Text: encrypted.

The command DECRYPT acts on a Text: field in the DRAFT-EDITOR.

Note: The Hermes encryption technique is not approved for the
      transmission of classified text.  (A warning is shown
      during the first and second ENCRYPT commands in each
      Hermes session.)  However, the Hermes algorithm has 
      been approved by the National Security Agency for the
      transmission of commercial data.

Syntax:      >>End-Date: <date> <CR>
		
End-Date: is a fixed field, of the DATE type.

A date field may contain only a single date.  A <CR>
terminates the field.  The date is stored in its typed-in
format.

You may enter the date as Today, Yesterday, or almost any
reasonable form of the date, such as 13 OCT 1978, 13-OCT-78,
October 13, 1978, or 10/13/78.


Syntax:     >ERASE   <object> <CR> [CONFIRM] <CR>
Default:               none

ERASE destroys an entire User-Created object, or the contents
of a current-object.  ERASE requires confirmation with <CR>
unless the DOUBLE-CONFIRM switch is set to NO.

In the DRAFT-EDITOR:
                              Headers
Syntax:    >>ERASE <line-nos> <field> <CR> [CONFIRM] <CR>
                                All

Defaults:                       All

ERASE erases the specified lines of a field.  If the
line-nos are omitted, erases the entire field.

ERASE Headers erases all fields except the Text: field.

If non-empty fields are present in the draft, should they be
erased before the prompts begin for the COMPOSE, REPLY or FORWARD
commands?

      ERASE-BEFORE-REPLY [X]Ask          Yes
      FORWARD-ERASE      [X]Ask          Yes
		

     In the TEMPLATE-EDITOR, the subcommands ERASE and SHOW act
on portions of the template:

t->ERASE<CR> or
t->ERASE ALL<CR>
Removes entire contents of the template.

t->ERASE <line number><CR>
Removes a template line.

t->ERASE <line number> <item number><CR>
Removes an item within a line.

t->SHOW<CR> or
t->SHOW ALL<CR>
Shows the entire template.

t->SHOW <line number><CR>
Shows a specific line.

<ESC>  Escape or ALT MODE key.  Provides extension and noise
words. Triggers recognition and extension of HERMES commands, of
names in the address-fields and of TENEX file-names.

Set your SPACE-FUNCTION-SWITCH to "NoiseWords" to make <SPACE>
act like <ESC>.

(EXAMPLE exists.)
If you type <ESC> in the middle of a command or object name, the
<ESC> "extends" and completes the word.  In most cases, <ESC>
also goes on and types the "noise words" or the next argument
which tell you what you should type next.

>Pr<ESC>int (messages)

When an argument contains a list of items, <ESC> merely extends
the item-names, since the system has no way of knowing whether
you intend to end the argument or continue it with another item.

If you type <ESC> at the beginning of an argument, the system
inserts the default argument.

>Pri<ESC>nt (messages)<ESC> CMESSAGE

At this point, a ",", "/" or ";" will allow you to continue the
sequence argument.  A SPACE or <ESC> will end the sequence
argument and prepare for the template argument.

>Print<ESC>(messages)<ESC>CMESSAGE<ESC>(using template)

Syntax:   EXAMPLE     <topic>     <depth>* <destination>  <CR>
Defaults:          Previous Topic    1          TTY:

The EXAMPLE command presents the user with a set of examples
illustrating the topic.  EXAMPLE defaults to the topic most
recently used in a DESCRIBE command.

* NOTE: The <depth> argument is included for uniformity.  Depth
  greater than 1 will print examples from all topics to the
  specified depth without indicating the names of the topics.

(EXAMPLE exists.)
>EXAMPLE DOCUMENT 1 LPT:<CR>
     Presents examples of the DOCUMENT command on the
     line-printer.
>DESCRIBE SURVEY<CR>
     Presents a description of SURVEY on your terminal.
>EXAMPLE<CR>
     Presents examples of the SURVEY command.

Syntax:     >>EXCHANGE  <field> <CR>
Default:                  TEXT

EXCHANGE prompts you with the word Old: and allows you to type
in a string of characters, ending with <CR>.  Then EXCHANGE prompts
New: and allow you to type in another string.

The command searches the contents of the field for the old string
and replaces each occurrance with the new string.

You can control the way the command works by setting the switches
listed in Related Topics.  Override the switches by typing ,<CR>
instead of <CR> after you type EXCHANGE and the field name (if it
is different from Text:).  You will get a +> prompt.  Type ? to
the +> prompt to see your choices:

Confirm    NoConfirm    MatchCase    NoMatchCase    Show    NoShow

Type in your choices, ending each choice with <CR>.  Then begin
the action of the EXCHANGE command by typing <CR> to the +>
prompt.
   Prints each exchange and allows you to confirm or not.
   Allows you match or not match upper and lower case in the 
   old string, but inserts the new string as typed.
   Lets you choose to show, or not to show, the exchanges.
   If set to No, overrides the CONFIRM-EXCHANGES-SWITCH.
   Shows numbered or unnumbered according to SHOW-FIELD-SWITCH.
Syntax: >EXEC<CR>

Exec allows you to use the TENEX or TOPS-20 Executive
program in a "lower fork" below the HERMES System.

The Exec prompt is "@".  To return to the HERMES System, type
"Quit" to the TENEX prompt or "Pop" to either the TENEX or
TOPS-20 prompt.

>EXEC<CR>
@QUIT<CR>   or   POP<CR>
>

The Exec command allows you use the full range of commands in the
Executive System without Quitting the HERMES System.

WARNING: The HERMES System retains the CMESSAGE-FILE it had when
you gave the Exec command.  If you intend to work upon that
message-file by calling another message-handling system (such as
MSG or HG), or an editing system (such as Teco), DO NOT use the
HERMES Exec command.  Instead, you should Quit the HERMES System
and enter the other system through a top-level Exec command.  The
HERMES System has interlocks to protect a message-file from a
second HERMES System -- your own or someone else's -- but there
are no interlocks to protect a message-file against other
systems.

You may use the Exec to connect to a second directory.  The
HERMES System retains the CMESSAGE-FILE it had when you gave the
Exec command;  however, in any subsequent commands, the HERMES
System defaults to the directories specified by the GET-DIRECTORY
and FROM-DIRECTORY switches.

(EXAMPLE exists.)
>COMPOSE<CR>
     User JONES creates a draft message, then decides to run a
     program, ALPHA.SAV, from the Exec.

>>EXEC<CR>
     JONES drops into a lower TENEX Exec.

@ALPHA<CR>
 ... Program ALPHA.SAV runs ...
@QUIT<CR>   or   POP<CR>
     JONES returns to the DRAFT-EDITOR in the HERMES System.
     His draft message is still intact.
   Synonym for EXEC on the TOPS-20.

Syntax:  >EXIT<CR>

     EXIT stops the HERMES Message System and returns the user to
the Operating System.  If you have deleted messages, EXIT asks
permission to EXPUNGE and renumber the message-file.  You may
continue the HERMES program after EXIT, by typing CONTINUE to
the TENEX/TOPS-20 prompt @.

QUIT and EXIT are identical, but have independent switches.
EXIT has subcommands that override the EXIT-EXPUNGE-SWITCH.
Type ,<CR> instead of <CR>.

(EXAMPLE exists.)
>EXIT<CR>
Message file <MYER>MESSAGE
  Messages 13:19,23 deleted;
  Expunge and renumber? Y<CR>
Stopping HERMES.
@
   One-letter synonym for QUIT

When you GET, QUIT or EXIT, should deleted messages in the old
message-file be Expunged?

      GET-EXPUNGE       [X]Ask           Yes          No
      QUIT-EXPUNGE      [X]Ask           Yes          No
      EXIT-EXPUNGE      [X]Ask           yes          No

To override these switches, type ",<CR>" instead of "<CR>" to
end the GET, QUIT or EXIT command.  Type ? to +> prompt to 
see the override commands.  End override mode by typing <CR> 
to +> prompt.

Syntax:     >EXPLODE <message-no.> <CR>
Default:    CMESSAGE

EXPLODE places an incoming message in the draft in the
DRAFT-EDITOR for further editing.

a) EXPLODE (or EDIT MESSAGE) preserves all fields in the
   original message.  All fields are editable, except for the
   Other:  field, and that field is preserved across an EDIT
   MESSAGE/REFILE even though it cannot be created in the DRAFT
   EDITOR or edited there.

b) No new fields are supplied when a message is REFILED.  If the
   draft does not contain a Sender or Date field, none will be
   added.  If the draft contains a Date field, that date will be
   placed in the refiled message with no modification at all.

   If you wish REFILE to tell you when the message was last
   edited either (1) change the Date field with, for example, the
   command

   >Date Today<CR>

   or (2) create a new user-field, such as Last-(Date), and fill
   it in.  There is no automatic way to add today's date when you
   REFILE.

c) If an EDITed (or EXPLODEd) message is placed in the
   DRAFT-EDITOR and then SENT, the Sender, Date and Message-ID
   are erased and HERMES supplies a new set, as occurred in
   versions of HERMES before 4.1.8.  SENDing a message with a
   file-name in the Fcc: field is an alternative to REFILE.

   If you SEND a message which has a non-empty FROM field
   originally supplied by an EXPLODE (or EDIT MESSAGE) command
   and not altered by you, and if this From field does not match
   either your login or connected directory, HERMES queries you:

      "From field is unaltered from exploded message.
      Send anyway?"

If the EXPLODED message contains user-fields, they are
automatically added to the USER-FIELDS collection.  This is a
convenient way of passing specialized user-fields from one user
to another.
   EDIT MESSAGE is a synonym for EXPLODE.  EXPLODE also exists
   in the DRAFT-EDITOR, and EDIT MESSAGE does not.
   Lets you choose between "Survey" (the default), "Confirm"
   or "No".
   Lets you choose whether you will be asked about refiling
   when you REDISTRIBUTE.

If non-empty fields are present in the draft, should they be
ERASEd by the EXPLODE or EDIT MESSAGE command?

  EXPLODE-ERASE     [X]Ask          Yes

Hermes has two commands that place a stored message (more than
one field) in the draft.  The EXPLODE command (and its synonym
EDIT MESSAGE) place a copy of a message in the current
message-file in the draft.  The RESTORE-DRAFT command places a
copy of a message stored in a draft-file in the draft.

For either command, if non-empty fields are present in the draft,
should they be erased before the new draft is appended?
	
      EXPLODE-ERASE     [X]Ask          Yes
      RESTORE-ERASE     [X]Ask          Yes          No

At top command level:
Syntax:   >EXPORT <object> <name><CR>
Default:            none  <object>

EXPORT copies an object from the Active Environment into the
Profile and names it <name>.

In the PROFILE-EDITOR:
Syntax:   >>EXPORT <object> <name><CR>
Default:             none  <object>

EXPORT copies an object from the Profile into the Active
Environment and names it <name>.

Syntax:   >EXPUNGE <CR>

EXPUNGE physically removes all DELETED messages from your
message-file.  The spaces left behind are closed up, and the
remaining messages are renumbered accordingly.

(EXAMPLE exists.)
     >SHOW ALLMESSAGES<CR>
        1:7
     >DELETE 2,4,5<CR>
       2,4,5
     >EXPUNGE<CR>
     >SHOW ALLMESSAGES<CR>
       1:4

Messages 2, 4, and 5 were expunged from your file.  The file was
renumbered as shown below:

     BEFORE:   1 2 3 4 5 6 7
     AFTER:    1   2   3   4

When you EXPUNGE a message-file, should the deleted messages
be physically removed and the remaining messages renumbered?

  EXPUNGE-RENUMBER     Ask       [X]Yes          No

If switch is set to NO, the deleted messages are transformed
into undeleted messages with a character count (length) of 0.

To override this switch, type ",<CR>" instead of "<CR>" to
end the EXPUNGE command.  Type ? to the +> prompt to see the
override commands.  End override mode by typing <CR> to the
+> prompt.

Each of the deleted messages was transformed into an
undeleted message with a character-count of 0.  The zero-
length message now consists of a machine-readable header
line, only:
	
4-May-81 10:32:45-EDT,0;000000000001

Since the zero-length message is undeleted, it may be
deleted again, and then expunged with the RENUMBER option.
If all the the other messages in the file have From:  fields
(as they usually will), the zero-length messages can be
selected with the message specification NOT FROM (i.e.,
select all messages that do NOT have a FROM field):
	
>DELETE NOT FROM
1:54,57,58
>EXPUNGE,
+>RENUMBER
+>
>STATUS
You are logged in as MOOERS.
4 messages in file <MOOERS>MAIL
1 unseen; 0 deleted; 1 reminders
   Describes the machine-readable header.

Syntax: >Fcc: <file-list> <CR>

Fcc: is a fixed field that accepts a list of file-names,
separated by commas.

When you SEND the draft message, a "file carbon copy" of your
message is transmitted to each of the message-files in the
Fcc: field.  The Fcc: field appears only on the copies that
go to the designated files.
   Beginning with HERMES 4.1.12, Fcc fields are stored
   without version numbers.

     The File and Move commands can take a "current destination"
named FDESTINATION.  The FDESTINATION is initially empty, but it
can be set to a new or existing message-file  by the SET command:

     >SET FDESTINATION SAVED-MSGS<CR> [Old version]<CR>

Now that FDESTINATION is set to SAVED-MSGS, messages can be filed
in SAVED-MSGS by the command:

     >FILE 1:3,17 FDESTINATION<CR>  or  >FILE 1:3,17<CR>
   Beginning with HERMES 4.1.12, Fcc fields are stored
   without version numbers in Fcc fields and in FDESTINATION
   and LDESTINATION.

To transfer the contents of one message-field to another,
use the SAVE-FIELD and APPEND-FILE commands.

(EXAMPLE exists.)
>>SHOW CC<CR>
Cc:  DDEUTSCH at BBN-TENEXA, BTHOMAS at BBN-TENEXB, 
     CALLEVA at BBN-TENEX
     To transfer the contents of the Cc:-field to a user-field
     named MISC-(PEOPLE).
>>SAVE-FIELD CC: TEMP<CR>
>>APPEND-FILE TEMP MISC-(PEOPLE)<CR>
>>SHOW MISC-(PEOPLE)<CR>
MISC-(PEOPLE):  DDEUTSCH at BBN-TENEXA, BTHOMAS at BBN-TENEXB,
                CALLEVA at BBN-TENEX
     You can get rid of TEMP by editing DRAFT-FILES.
>>DONE<CR>
>EDIT DRAFT-FILES<CR>
>>DELETE TEMP<CR>
>>DONE<CR>

When you compose a draft, the usual CTEMPLATE (the default for
COMPOSE) prompts you for the four fields.  (These are also
commands at the >> prompt.)

Field Name      Data-Type
  To:           ADDRESSEE  SEND distributes draft to addressees
                           in To:, Cc: and Bcc:.  Ends with <CR>.
  Cc:           ADDRESSEE  Carbon Copy.  Ends with <CR>.
  Subject:        LINE     Plain text.  Ends with <CR>.
  Text:           TEXT     Main body of the message.  Text:
                           allows <CR>s; ends with <CTRL-Z>.

Sometimes you may want to use other "fixed fields", i.e., field
names supplied by HERMES, as commands at the >> prompt, or in
composing templates that you create.

  Bcc:          ADDRESSEE  Blind Carbon Copy.  Bcc names seen
                            only by others on the Bcc list.
  Fcc:            FILE     File Carbon Copy. SEND distributes
                            draft to files in Fcc:.
  From:           LINE     SEND fills in From:, if you do not.

The following fixed fields are automatically filled in by HERMES.
They could be typed as commands at >>, but there is usually no
reason to do so.

  In-Reply-To:        Filled in by the REPLY command.
  Redistributed-By:   Filled in by the REDISTRIBUTE command.
  Redistributed-Date:   "    "  "   "       "          "
  Redistributed-By:     "    "  "   "       "          "

The PRINT-FORM template also contains three template items which
as a "pseudo-fields"; they are not commands at the >> prompt.

  Other:              displays the "Mail from..."  line and any
                      other text not part of either a fixed field
                      or a user field.
  Rcvd-Date:          Extracted by HERMES from the "Mail from..."
                      line; used in PRINT-FORM and SURVEY-FORM
                      to show the date relative to the receiver
                      rather than the sender.
  User-Fields:        Displays all fields created (by someone, at
                      some time) through the use of the USER-
                      FIELDS editor; NOT fixed fields.

All the fields listed above are displayed by the PRINT command as
it is set up in your initial profile.  (The default PTEMPLATE is
set to a copy of the PRINT-FORM template.)


This leaves a group of fixed fields that are NOT displayed by the
PRINT-FORM template.  You can EDIT your PTEMPLATE to include any
of them, if you wish, or if you just want to check up on them,
use the command

     >PRINT <message> LONG-PRINT-FORM<CR>

Three fixed fields in this group are automatically filled in by
HERMES, whenever a draft is SENT or REFILED as a new message, but
they are not changed when a draft is REFILED over an existing
message.  They are not displayed in the PRINT-FORM template
because the information they contain is more or less redundant.

  Date:               Date and time that message was sent.
  Sender:             Login directory of sender.
  Message-ID:         Unique identifier based on Sender and Date.

There is another group of fixed fields which are NOT filled
automatically, are NOT displayed by the PRINT-FORM template, and
are seldom used in informal messages, although they are available
as commands at >> or as template items.

Start-Date:, End-Date: and Suspense-Date: are DATE-type fields
that accept a single date.

Action: acts like a user-field of the ADDRESSEE type.  SEND does
NOT distribute the draft to addresses in Action:.

Keywords, Assigned-By:, Class-Char:, Info:, Message-Class:,
Precedence:, Reference: and Special-Handling: are all LINE-type
fields.
   Filled in by HERMES, when the message is sent and received.
   Syntax for user-names and addressee-lists.  GROUPNAMEs.
   Field names created by the user; four possible datatypes.
   All fields other than the Text: field.
   All lines in the message that are not part of the Text:
   field.  Also called header fields.

Syntax:   >FILE  <messages>  <message-file> <CR>

Defaults:        CSEQUENCE   FDESTINATION
Initial
Settings:           ALL        [Empty]

     FILE places copies of messages from the currently active
message-file into some other message-file.  If the specified file
exists, the messages are appended to its present contents.  If
the message-file does not yet exist, it is created at this time.

HERMES asks whether to delete the filed messages from the
current message-file.

FILE and MOVE are identical, but have independent switches.

(EXAMPLE exists.)
>FILE 3,1,4:6 SAVED-MSGS<CR> [New file]<CR>
Delete messages after filing? Yes<CR>
3,1,4:6 filed and deleted.

You may answer "Y" instead of "Yes".  If you do not want to
delete the message, answer "No" or "N".
>FILE 7,9,11 SAVED-MSGS<CR> [Old version]<CR>
Delete messages after filing? N<CR>
7,9,11 filed.

When you FILE or MOVE a message should the original message be
deleted?

      FILE-DELETE       [X]Ask           Yes          No
      MOVE-DELETE       [X]Ask           Yes          No

To override these switches, type ",<CR>" instead of "<CR>" to
end the FILE or MOVE command.  Type ? to +> prompt to see the
override commands.  End override mode by typing <CR> to +>.

Place a template in a file with the command:

       >SHOW <templatename>  (to file) <filename><CR>

Files written from Hermes templates, or ones prepared by hand
that mimic them, can be input to a template via the template
editor command:

       t->FILE-INSERT <filename> (before line no)  <line-number><CR>

The default for the line number is 1.

(Example exists.)

TECHNICAL NOTE ON THE FILE-INSERT COMMAND

There are a few additional ground rules for parsing the input to
a template from a file, which are different from input from the
terminal.

  A.  Anything enclosed by <whitespace>( on the left and ) or
      <EOL> on the right is ignored.  This eliminates the line
      numbers that the outputter produces, and can also be used
      for included comments.  However, this rule does not apply
      to string enclosed in template delimiters, as in literal
      fields and quoted strings.

  B.  The contents of literals must be delimited, so the
      inputter tries to identify delimiters.  It tries to see if
      the first non-whitespace following the word "literal" is
      one of the recognized beginning delimiters.  If not, it
      interprets that character through the end of the line as
      the contents of the literal.  If so, it scans from the
      next character on, searching for the corresponding ending
      delimiter; what lies between the delimiters is
      interpreted as the contents of the literal.

  C.  If a literal runs to more than one line, the outputter
      produces the keyword at the beginning of the second and
      following lines.  To correspond, the inputter tries to
      recognize the first word on the second and following
      lines of multi-line literals as the keyword for the field
      involved (defined on the first line of the literal).  If
      the first word is the keyword, it is removed.

  D.  The outputter produces an "echo" of the show command that
      invoked it (possibly followed by a blank line) before the
      output of the template, as in the example above.  Also,
      an empty template causes the output "[Empty; prints
      nothing]".  Therefore, the inputter ignores any line on
      which the first non-whitespace character is either [ or
      >, and also ignores the next line if blank.

     1. TENEX/TOPS-20: File-names follow TENEX or TOPS-20
        conventions, and must be deleted outside HERMES, through 
        the use of the operating system.

     2. HERMES: File-handling can be accomplished entirely within
        HERMES.   File-names act like HERMES objects as long as 
        you are within HERMES, and appear as <DIRECTORY>NAME.
        In the connected directory, <DIRECTORY> may be omitted.
        Files are deleted with the MESSAGE-FILES-EDITOR
        and the DRAFT-FILES-EDITOR.  The names TERMINAL and
        LINE-PRINTER may be used as synonyms for TTY: and LPT:.

     Note: You can "escape" from HERMES filenames to TENEX or 
     TOPS-20 filenames in a HERMES command  by typing ! before 
     you type in the filename.

HERMES 4.1.12 stores filenames without version numbers in Fcc:
fields in messages, literal Fcc: fields in templates, and in FDESTINATION and LDESTINATION.

This means that if you have more than one version of a file in your
directory, Hermes will always pick the highest version.

This schange should make things work correctly for people who have
HERMES filenames, i.e., who have their FILENAME-INPUT switch set to
HERMES.  The change also allows templates with literal FCC fields to be
used with different version-nos. of the same file.

YOU MUST CHANGE YOUR TEMPLATES AND THE SETTINGS OF YOUR FDESTINATION
OR LDESTINATION TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THIS CHANGE IN HERMES 4.1.12.

(EXample exists.)
Suppose you have an existing template with a literal Fcc: field
and an existing setting for your FDESTINATION.

HERMES allows you to SHOW and DELETE two kinds of files:
message-files, which contain messages, and draft-files, which
contain any other kind of text.

You have a choice of handling files through the operating system
(TENEX or TOPS-20) or from within Hermes.  The FILENAME-INPUT
switch in HERMES 4.1.12 is intially SET to HERMES.  If you have
an older profile in which the switch is set to TENEX or TOPS-20,
we strongly recommend that you change it to HERMES:
	
>EDIT SWITCHES<CR>
x->SET FILENAME-INPUT HERMES<CR>
x->SHOW FILENAME-INPUT<CR>
FILENAME-INPUT       TOPS-20   [X]HERMES
x->DONE<CR>
		
Now you can SHOW and DELETE files from within HERMES.

The names of all message-files are listed in an object called
MESSAGE-FILES.  The names of draft-files are listed in
DRAFT-FILES.  You can SHOW them with the commands:
	
>SHOW MESSAGE-FILES<CR>
>SHOW DRAFT-FILES<CR>
		
You can delete them by first editing MESSAGE-FILES or
DRAFT-FILES, then using the DELETE command.  (Type EXAMPLE for
more information.)

HERMES filenames are recognized and extended by the same
conventions as the names of other HERMES objects.

HERMES filenames may consist of any combination of upper-case
letters, numbers, the dollar-sign "$", the underscore "_" and the
hyphen "-", and may not be more than 30 characters long.

The user's terminal has the name TERMINAL (as well as TTY:) and
the line-printer has the name LINE-PRINTER (as well as LPT:).

   Beginning with HERMES 4.1.12, Fcc fields are stored
   without version numbers in Fcc fields and in FDESTINATION
   and LDESTINATION.

Top-Level Commands (> prompt):
CREATE FILTER name   Creates a new filter.
EDIT name            Edits an existing filter.

Subcommands (f-> prompt):
DONE                 Makes changes permanent.  Returns to >.
ABORT                Aborts changes.  Returns to >.
ERASE                Erases contents of filter.
IGNORE     criteria  Used to countermand a REQUIRE or REJECT.
REJECT     criteria  Specifies criteria that must NOT be met.
REQUIRE    criteria  Specifies criteria that must be met.
SHOW                 Shows entire current filter.
ON         date      Requires Date: on specified date.
BEFORE     date      Requires Date: before specified date.
AFTER      date      Requires Date: on or after specified date.

Criteria are specified as (a) a fixed filter or as (b) a field
followed by a specification of the contents.  This may include
multiple strings separated by commas, which specify the "union"
operation.  Strings containing spaces must be enclosed in quotes.

A "filter" is a HERMES object for searching a message-file.
A filter may be used as a complete message specification, or
a part of a message specification.  Filters are stored in the
PROFILE.

         Ex.: >PRINT UNSEEN<CR>

Current:          Contents can be EDITed or Changed with SET.
 CFILTER          Inserted after "/" if you type <ESC>.
                   Initially set to accept all messages.

User:             CREATE your own User Filters.  

Fixed:            Fixed filters cannot be EDITed or SET.
 DELETED          Selects deleted messages.
 SEEN             Selects messages that have been printed
                   through a template that includes Text:.
 UNDELETED        Selects messages NOT deleted.
 UNSEEN           Selects messages NOT SEEN.
 NEW              Selects messages that arrived during the
                   current Hermes session.
 RECENT           Selects messages that arrived after the
                   last Hermes session.
 OLD              Selects message not NEW or RECENT.
 EMPTY-FILTER     Passes all messages.

When you leave Hermes, should the system check to see whether
there are any erased fields in the DRAFT-EDITOR, and ask
"Quit anyway?"

  FINAL-DRAFT-CHECK [X]Yes          No


When you leave Hermes, should the system check to see whether
you have new mail, report the new message, and ask "Quit
anyway?"?
	
  FINAL-MAIL-CHECK  [X]Yes          No

Hermes includes a "fixer" that can repair most "broken"
message-files.  Message-files are "broken" when the
character-count of a message does not match the actual
length of the message.  The most frequent cause of an
unexpected broken message is a network crash or similar
disaster.

Message-files may also be broken because someone has edited
the file with an editor such as Teco or Xed and changed the
length of a message.  Be sure to check the message that was
reported not to "parse".  There may be some text missing, or
two messages may be combined.

  FIX-BROKEN-FILE   [X]Ask          Yes          No
When Hermes encounters a fatal error, the error message printed
on the user's terminal now includes instructions for running the
program FIX-HERMES (formerly called KILLPARSE).

FIX-HERMES removes the "parse" portion of the "parseq" file,
which is a "companion file" for your message-file.  The "parse"
contains information about the location of the messages and their
individual fields.  This information is constantly updated by
Hermes, and may become deranged if the parseq file is open when
the host computer crashes or a Hermes session ends with <CTRL-C>.

After you run FIX-HERMES, and then enter Hermes again, the parse
must be reconstructed.  The parse information is kept in a
separate file to protect the messages in the message-file.
Hermes automatically constructs a parseq file for each
message-file, and names it to correspond to the message-file.
For example, the message-file named MAIL.TXT.1 has a parseq file
named ^MAIL.TXT^.1.  FIX-HERMES requires you to type ONLY the
message-file name, i.e., MAIL.TXT.

FIX-HERMES has proved to fix a large majority of errors currently
reported by Hermes users.

The FIX-HERMES instructions do not appear if there is no current
message-file.

(Example exists.)
When a fatal error occurs and there is a current message-file,
the following error messages is displayed on the terminal:

Technical error message:
 <This varies according to the type of error.>

XHERMES cannot continue.
... But first-aid is available!  Run the program FIX-HERMES:

        Message file name:
Fill in the message file name, in the form NAME.TXT<cr>.
The program should reply: "Done.  Be sure to check sequences."
Enter HERMES, and GET the message file.  Hermes will pause to
"reparse" the file.  (Type DESCRIBE FIX-HERMES for more info.)

HERMES supplies a set of fixed fields, which come in five
different datatypes:

The header-fields normally end with <CR>:

    1) LINE-type fields contain plain text: From:, Subject:,
       Keywords: and others.

    2) ADDRESSEE-type fields contain a list of addressees: To:,
       Cc: and Bcc:.

    3) DATE-type fields contain a single date: Start-Date:,
       End-Date and Suspense-Date:.

    4) FILE-type fields contain a list of file names:  There is
       only one such field, Fcc:.

The message is divided into header-fields and text.  Thus the
only field that is NOT a header-field is the Text: field.

Text: is also the only fixed TEXT-type field, i.e., it contains
plain text, but it ends with <CTRL-Z> rather than <CR>, to allow
the user to use carriage returns normally in the text.
   Fields similar to fixed-fields, but named by the user.
   Syntax for user-names and addressee lists.
   For naming addressee lists.

Fixed sequences, filters and templates are like constants in
mathematics.  They can neither be created nor destroyed, nor
can their values be changed.  On the other hand, they exist
merely for convenience and impose nothing on the user.

(EXAMPLE exists.)
The CREATE, EDIT and ERASE commands cannot be used on
fixed objects.

However, you can use the COPY command to copy the contents of
a fixed objects into a user-created object.  Also, you can
SET the contents to of a current object to the contents of a
fixed object.
	
     >COPY STANDARD NEW-TEMPLATE<CR>

You can now edit NEW-TEMPLATE, using the EDIT command.

     >SET PTEMPLATE STANDARD<CR>
	
Syntax:      >>FORMAT <line-nos> <field> <CR>
Default:                          Text
		
Format adjusts ragged lines within the range of numbers
specified by the line-nos.  Short lines are filled by
bringing up words from the next line; long lines are broken
at word boundaries.  The maximum line length is 65 characters
for text fields, and shorter (by the length of the
field-name) for header fields; this cannot be changed.

PARAGRAPHS: The text must be single spaced.  A completely
blank line indicates that the next line begins a new
paragraph.  The first line of a paragraph may be indented any
number of spaces.  Otherwise, all multiple spaces and
<CTRL-I>'s (tabs) are turned into single space characters by
the formatter.

TURNING THE FORMATTER OFF: A line containing a single
<CTRL-I> (or tab) and no other characters, turns off the
formatter for the following text.  This allows tabular
material, or other user-formatted text, to remaim untouched.
A line containing two <CTRL-I>'s, and no other characters,
turns the formatter on again.  When you insert messages in
the text of another message with the FORWARD or INCLUDE
command, the formatting of the included message is
automatically protected by <CTRL-I>'s.

NOTE: If the line-nos in the FORMAT command do not include
the single <CTRL-I>, it does not protect against formatting.

The Formatter is idempotent, i.e., once used, the formatter
can be called again, with no change to the text.

>>Subject: This is the subject<CR>
>>Subject: of my message.<CR>
>>Subject: I can create a runover,<CR>
           line by typing a comma at the end of the line.<CR>
>>Show Subject<CR>
Subject: This is the subject
         of my message.
         I can create a runover
         line by typing a comma at the end of the line.
>>Format 1:2 Subject<CR>
>>Show Subject<CR>
Subject: This is the subject of my message.
         I can create a runover
         line by typing a comma at the end of the line.
>>Format 2:3 Subject<CR>
>>Show Subject<CR>
Subject: This is the subject of my message.
         I can create a runover line by typing a comma at the end
         of the line.
>>Format Subject<CR>
>>Show Subject<CR>
Subject: This is the subject of my message.  I can create a
         runover line by typing a comma at the end of the line.
   When you complete a Text field, should the system
   automatically execute a FORMAT command?
   The "Justify" setting evens up the right-hand margin  by
   inserting spaces between words.  (Neat, but hard to read!)

When you FORMAT a field, should the text be right justified?

      FORMAT-JUSTIFY       Ask           Yes       [X]No

To override this switch, type ",<CR>" instead of "<CR>" to end
the FORMAT command.  Type ? to +> prompt to see the override 
commands.  End override mode by typing <CR> to +> prompt.

Syntax:  >FORWARD <messages>  <template>  <template> <CR>
Default:           CMESSAGE   FCTEMPLATE    FITEMPLATE

Initial              ---      FORWARD-      FORWARD-
Settings:                     COMPOSE-FORM  INCLUDE-FORM
		
FORWARD prompts for the To: field, gives the user a chance to
enter comments.  then prompts for a Subject: field and set up
the Subject: field to reference the forwarded messages.

FORWARD "packages" the messages to be forwarded in the
message just built, and then requests permission to send it.

(EXAMPLE exists.)
>FORWARD 9<CR>
To: MACGILLIVRAY
Comments (to ^Z):
No need to reply.
Ted <CTRL-Z>^Z
Subject: For your information.
Send?: Yes<CR>

Should FORWARD prompt for  comments  to  precede  a  forwarded
message?

      FORWARD-COMMENTS     Ask        [X]Yes          No

If non-empty fields are present in the draft, should they be
erased before the prompts begin for the COMPOSE, REPLY or FORWARD
commands?

      COMPOSE-ERASE      [X]Ask          Yes          No
      ERASE-BEFORE-REPLY [X]Ask          Yes
      FORWARD-ERASE      [X]Ask          Yes
		

After the COMPOSE, REPLY or FORWARD command has completed
prompting you for the set of fields, should the message
automatically be sent?

      COMPOSE-SEND      [X]Ask           Yes          No
      FORWARD-SEND      [X]Ask           Yes          N0
      REPLY-SEND        [X]Ask           Yes          No
	
Syntax:      >>From: <characters> <CR>
		
From: is a LINE-TYPE field.  It accepts any characters, and
is terminated with a <CR>.

To continue to a another line, type a comma before the <CR>.

Hermes automatically fills in the From: field with your
connected directory, unless you insert a From: field in your
message.  You may create a From: field either by typing one
in or by placing a literal From: field in the template you
use with the COMPOSE, REPLY or FORWARD command.


You may set a switch so that the From: field defaults to the
user-name for either the LOGIN or the CONNECTED directory.

    1. Login.  Useful if you compose your own messages but work
       in some other directory.

    2. Connected.  Useful if the Connected Directory belongs to
       the author of the messages, and you provide secretarial
       help.

      FROM-DIRECTORY    [X]Login         Connected

Syntax:     >GET <message-file> <CR>
Defaults:           MESSAGE*

GET causes HERMES to switch attention from the currently active
message-file to another.  HERMES leaves the current message-file,
first requesting permission to expunge any messages marked for
deletion.  All subsequent operations (until QUIT, EXIT, or
another GET) affect only the new message-file.

* NOTE: If your FILENAME-INPUT switch is set to TENEX or TOPS-20,
your INBOX file-name will have the operating-system form:

      TENEX:      MESSAGE.TXT;1
      TOPS-20:    MAIL.TXT.1

(EXAMPLE exists.)
>STATUS<CR>
29 Messages in file <MYER>MEMOS
3 UNSEEN: 6 DELETED
>GET DEC76<CR>
Message-file <MYER>MEMOS
Messages 10,13:15,22 deleted;
Expunge and renumber?: Y<CR>

>STATUS<CR>
67 Messages in file <MYER>DEC76
5 UNSEEN; 2 DELETED

You may log-in to one directory and then connect to another.
Out of which directory should HERMES GET message-files?

    1. Login.  Useful if you work in a connected directory but
       wish to process messages arriving in your Login
       Directory.  The Source: template item (used in the 
       SURVEY-FORM template) prints the To: field if the
       message has the login directory in the From: or 
       Sender: field.

    2. Connected.  Useful if you connect to a directory to
       process the message files it contains.  Source: works 
       with respect to the connected directory.

      GET-DIRECTORY        Login      [X]Connected

When you GET, QUIT or EXIT, should deleted messages in the old
message-file be EXPUNGEd?

      GET-EXPUNGE       [X]Ask           Yes          No
      QUIT-EXPUNGE      [X]Ask           Yes          No
      EXIT-EXPUNGE      [X]Ask           Yes          No

To override these switches, type ",<CR>" instead of "<CR>" to end
the GET, QUIT or EXIT command.  Type ? to +> prompt to see the
override commands.  End override mode by typing <CR> to the +>
prompt.

An <addressee-list> can be given a groupname:

         <groupname>: <addressee-list>

where <groupname> is any string of characters that does not
contain a <ESC>, <LF>, <CR>, @, "," or ":".

You can end an <addressee-list> at any point by typing ",:,".
HERMES automatically inserts ",:" when you type <CR>.

1) GROUPNAMES IN THE TO, CC AND BCC FIELDS

For the To:, Cc: or Bcc: fields in the draft message, only
the groupname followed by ":" when  you use the SHOW command.
However, you can show the complete <addressee-list>, as typed
by using the subcommand Show TypedForm.  The <addressee-list>
IS NOT transmitted when the Draft message is SENT, and so
does not appear in, and cannot be recovered from, the
received message.

2) GROUPNAMES IN USERFIELDS OF THE ADDRESSEE TYPE

In user fields with the form NAME-(ADDRESSEE), NAME-(ADDR) 
and NAME-(PEOPLE), the groupname and the list that follows it are
always shown in full.  Since the primary purpose of these
addressee-type user fields is to transmit lists of addressees
the <addressee-list> is always transmitted when the draft
message is SENT.

(EXAMPLE exists.)
>To: Acquaintances: Smith@BBN, @HAWAII-ALOHA, Jones,
     Robinson (Special-Group),:,Friends: Dodds, JMiller,<CR>
>Show To<CR>
To:  Acquaintances:, Friends:
>Show Typed-Form<CR>
To: Acquaintances: SMITH at BBN-TENEX, JONES at HAWAII-ALOHA,
    ROBINSON at HAWAII-ALOHA (Attn: Special-Group),:,
    Friends: Dodds at BBN-TENEXA, JMiller at BBN-TENEXA,:

Note that in this case, the "default host computer" is
BBN-TENEXA, because it is the local host.  At the end of the
first groupname list, the host automatically reverts to the
default.

You can now SAVE the To:-field to use as a mailing list at some
later date.  One useful practice is to give a list a "path"
name, so that anyone receiving the message will know where to
find the file containing the original list.

>To: [BBNA]<MYER>Acq-Friends.HRM: Smith@BBN, @HAWAII-ALOHA,
Jones, Robinson (Special-Group), @BBNA, Dodds, JMiller
>SAVE-FIELD To <MYER>Acq-Friends<CR> [New File] <CR>

Here, ".HRM" is included in the pathname, because it is the
TENEX/TOPS-20 extension that Hermes uses for DRAFT-FILES when
your FILENAME-INPUT switch is set to HERMES.

If your FILENAME-INPUT switch is set to TENEX or TOPS-20, you would
type:

>SAVE-FIELD To <MYER>Acq-Friends.Hrm<CR> [New File] <CR>

You can now place the "Acq-Friends" list in a user field in
the same message or in a new message:

>EDIT USER-FIELDS<CR>
>>ADD NewList-(Addr)<CR>
>>DONE<CR>
>EDIT<CR>
>>APPEND-FILE <MYER>ACQ-FRIENDS NEWLIST-(ADDR)<CR>
>>SHOW NEWLIST-(ADDR)<CR>
NewList-(Addr): [BBNA]<MYER>Acq-Friends.HRM: Smith@BBN, @HAWAII-ALOHA,
                Jones, Robinson (Special-Group), @BBNA, Dodds, JMiller

The Headers (or Header) of a message consists of all the lines in
the message except the Text: field.

When you print a message with the LONG-PRINT-FORM template, which
makes a verbatim copy of the message, you can see that the Text:
field is the part of the message that follows the first
completely blank line in the message.

All the header lines come before the first blank line.  Most
headers consist of the name of the field, followed by a colon and
a space.  For example, this the way a two-line Subject: field
looks when it is printed through the LONG-PRINT-FORM template:

     Subject: This is the subject of the message.
     Subject: This is the second line of the Subject: field.

When the same field is printed through PRINT-FORM (or any
template with the Subject: field on a line by itself, so that
the field is not truncated), it looks like this:

     Subject: This is the subject of the message.
              This is the second line of the Subject: field.

The Mail-from: and  Received-Date: fieldsare appended to the
message by the network delivery program, FTP server, or by Hermes
or another message system imitating the FTP server.

     Mail-from: BBND
     Received-Date: 6-Aug-81 1445-EDT

Older messages may have the earlier form of this information,
which does not have a field name::

     Mail from BBN-TENEX rcvd at 14-Jun-79 1234

Hermes will accept either form.

Each message also has a machine-readable header, appended by the
FTP server (or by Hermes for messages delivered by Hermes alone)
when the message is placed in the recipient's message-file.

     14-Jun-79 12:34:56-EDT,876;000000000000

This line is never printed by Hermes, but can be seen if a
message-file is placed in a editor, such as Teco or XED, or
brought into the Text: field of a message with the APPEND-FILE
command, or <CTRL-B>.
Syntax:       HELP <destination><CR>
Defaults:              TTY:

     The HELP command is designed to aid users just getting
started with HERMES.  HELP presents basic topics and asks the
user to choose the ones to be printed out.

The Hermes DESCRIBE topics have not been updated since HERMES
4.1.18 (released in August 1981).  For the benefit of some users
on ISID and ISIE, who did not use Hermes 4.1.18 when it was
first released, this topic lists the new features that were
introduced at that time.  For information on new features for
NEWHERMES 4.3.3 (April 1982), and HERMES 4.2.2 (January 1982),
see the topic NEW-FEATURES.
   The MARK <msgs> REMIND command causes messages to appear
   in every initial survey, marked with *.  (4.1.18)
   You can set this switch to NO, and EXPUNGE will change
   your deleted messages to zero-length undeleted messages,
   preserving the message numbers.  (4.1.18)
   The new FILE-INSERT command allows you to input files
   to the TEMPLATE-EDITOR.  FILE-INSERT and SHOW allow you
   to edit templates in an ordinary text editor.  (4.1.18)
   You can now use any of a large set of delimiters in the
   of template editor, instead of the "..." pair.  (4.1.18)
   The DEC-supported editor, TV, which is a screen version
   of DEC TECO, is available in Hermes on TOPS-20.  (4.1.18)
   The EMACS editor is available in Hermes.  (4.1.18)
   Hermes allows you to input dates and search for dates by
   the day of the week, in a 3-week window.  (4.1.18)
   Hermes handles all filenames and logical device names in
   TOPS20, Version 4.	(4.1.18)
   Hermes now tells you how to use FIX-HERMES (formerly KILL-
   PARSE) when a crash occurs.  (4.1.18)

The HERMES Message System is one product of Project HERMES, a
Bolt Beranek and Newman, Inc., research and development
effort in advanced forms of message technology.  Project
HERMES is supported by the DoD Advanced Research Projects
Agency, by the Naval Electronics Systems Command, and by the
U. S. Army Development and Readiness Command.

The HERMES program was first implemented for host computers
using the TENEX Executive System developed at Bolt Beranek
and Newman, Inc.  for the DEC PDP-10 computer.  In 1977,
HERMES was modified to run on the TOPS-20 Operating System.

In this documentation, the operating system is sometimes
referred to as "TENEX" or the "Exec".  Most of the operating
system functions are identical in TENEX and TOPS-20, and
notes are provided in the few places where the two operating
system cause HERMES to act differently.

See the related topics.

Syntax:    f->IGNORE <filter-criterion> <CR>
Defaults:                 none

     IGNORE removes a filter criterion from a filter without
replacing it.

(EXAMPLE exists.)
f->SHOW
REQUIRE SEEN
REQUIRE SUBJECT: "NEXT MEETING"
REQUIRE DATE: AFTER 21 DEC 1976
     Thus the filter contains 3 filtering criteria.

To reduce it to a simple time-filter one could type:
f->IGNORE SEEN<CR>
f->IGNORE SUBJECT:<CR>
f->SHOW
REQUIRE DATE: AFTER 21 DEC 1976
     Thus, both the SUBJECT and SEEN criteria are gone.

At top command level:
Syntax:   >IMPORT <object> <name><CR>
Default:            none  <object>

IMPORT copies an object from the Profile into the Active
Environment and names it <name>.

In the PROFILE-EDITOR:
Syntax:   >>IMPORT <object> <name><CR>
Default:             none  <object>

IMPORT copies an object from the Active Environment into the
Profile and names it <name>.
	
Syntax:      >>In-Reply-To: <characters> <CR>
		
In-Reply-To: is a LINE-TYPE field.  It accepts any characters,
and is terminated with a <CR>.

To continue to a another line, type a comma before the <CR>.

In-Reply-To is automatically filled in by REPLY.

If you do not have a current message-file (because
STARTWITHINBOX is set to NO, or because you have typed the
UNGET command), and you type a command, such as SURVEY, which
requires a message-file, what should Hermes do?

    1. Ask: Report "Getting <USER>MESSAGE (or <USER>MAIL)"
       and ask "OK?:"

    2. Yes: Automatically GET your Inbox, with report.

    3. No: Report "?No message-file; can't transcribe
       messages."

  INBOXONDEMAND     [X]Ask          Yes          No

Syntax:  >>INCLUDE  <messages>  <template> <CR>
Default:             CMESSAGE    ITEMPLATE
Initial
Setting:               ---      INCLUDE-FORM

INCLUDE places a copy of one or more messages at the end of
the Text: field in the draft message.  This command has the
same effect on the Text: field as FORWARD, but it does not
prompt for or fill in any header fields, nor request
permission to send.

INCLUDE is available only as a second-level command in the 
draft-editor.

For an alphabetic INDEX of the topics that can be accessed by the
documentation commands, type
     >DESCRIBE ?

For a list of all topics beginning with a letter, or letters,
for example, SU, type
     >DESCRIBE SU?

When you enter HERMES or GET a new message-file, you
see an initial survey of all the recent messages, i.e., those
that have arrived since you last saw the message-file.

The initial survey is printed through your STEMPLATE.  You can
turn it off with the INITIAL-SURVEY-SWITCH.  

NOTE: If you have never accessed the message-file before, you
will not get an initial survey in any case.

On start up or after Get, should the HERMES System  print  a
survey  of recent messages?

 INITIAL-SURVEY       Ask        [X]Yes          No

Should the correction characters for typing commands and
editing fields be the same as on your local host computer,
or should they be changed while you are in HERMES to conform
to either TOPS-20 or TENEX?  This switch is useful if you 
change from one host to another and do not want to change
your typing habits.

<CTRL-A>     TENEX: Deletes a single character.
<RUBOUT/DEL>   "    Aborts a command.  No effect in text.

<RUBOUT/DEL> TOPS-20: Deletes a single character.
<CTRL-U>       "      Deletes a text line; aborts a command.

INPUT-CORRECTION  [X]LocalSystem    TOPS-20      TENEX

Syntax:        >>INSERT  <line-no.> <field> <CR>
Default:                    End      Text:

INSERT allows you to insert text before a specified line number
in a field.  The insertion begins when you type the <CR> on the
command line, and ends with either <CR> for all field except
TEXT-type fields, or with <CTRL-Z> for TEXT-type fields.

The effect of allowing the command to default to End and Text: is
the same as appending to the Text: field with a Text: command.
>>SHOW Text numbered<CR>
1     Sometimes we need to edit
2     in the middle of the Text.
>>INSERT 2<CR>
even well-considered Text: fields
<CTRL-Z>
>>SHOW Text unnumbered<CR>
Sometimes we need to edit
even well-considered Text: fields
in the middle of the Text.


When you use a command that creates the current draft (CDRAFT)
what interface style should Hermes use?

  1. Ask. (Default setting.)

  2. Editor interface
     You are placed in your default editor. The editor
     buffer contains the whole draft, including both header
     fields and the Text: field. You can use the editor
     commands to move freely from field to field without
     leaving the editor.  Best for EMACS or WE.	
     For more documentation see the file WHOLEDRAFT-HERMES.LPT
     in the <HERMES> directory on your local host computer.

  3. Command-line interface.
     This is the old Hermes. Commands that use templates
     prompt you one line at a time, and then place you in
     DRAFT-EDITOR. Additions or changes to the CDRAFT are
     made by command lines typed at the >> prompt.

To override this switch, type ",<cr>" instead of "<cr>" to end
the SEND command.  Type ? to +> prompt to see the override
commands.  End override mode by typing <cr> to +> prompt.
   Sets the default editor to EMACS, TECO, WE XED or None.
   The current draft, i.e., the unsent message that is
   being created in Hermes.

  INTERFACE-STYLE      Ask          Editor    [X]Command-Line

This switch takes effect with every command that allows you to
edit the current draft (CDRAFT).  See the booklet in the
file <HERMES>WHOLEDRAFT-HERMES>DOC for more information.

The intial setting, Command-Line, is interface style of versions
of Hermes before 4.3.3.  Override the setting of INTERFACE-STYLE
by typing ",<CR>" instead of "<CR>" at the end of the command.

Syntax:     s->INTERSECT <messages><CR>
Defaults:                   none

     INTERSECT is a subcommand of the SEQUENCE-EDITOR that forms
the logical intersection between the sequence under construction
and another set of messages.

(EXAMPLE exists.)
     Suppose you had constructed two sequences; JONESMITH, which
contained all correspondence between JONES and SMITH, and
WEATHER, which contained all messages about weather.  You can
create a new sequences which contains all correspondence between
Jones and Smith about weather by:

>CREATE SEQUENCE JONESMITHWEATHER<CR>
s->ADD JONESMITH<CR>
s->INTERSECT WEATHER<CR>
s->DONE<CR>

The HERMES Message System is a computer program for sending and
receiving messages, which is available on a number of host
computers on the ARPA Network.

HERMES has features that help the user read messages, compose
messages for sending, and create and manage files that contain
messages or drafts of messages.

The major topics in this documentation facility are listed in the
Related Topics, below.  These are also the first topics displayed
in outline form when you type

      >OUTLINE<CR>

These topics give summaries of HERMES commands and objects.  To
display each topic on your terminal, type the DESCRIBE command,
followed by the name or number of the topic, and <CR>.  When you
see the > prompt, type EXAMPLE and <CR>, and HERMES will print an
example of the topic just DESCRIBED.

The topic SUMMARY describes the basic HERMES commands for reading
and sending messages, and tells how to type commands and get
information about the system.

     >DESCRIBE SUMMARY<CR>   or   >DESCRIBE 1<CR>
     >EXAMPLE<CR>

To print the complete set of summaries on the lineprinter, with a
single DOCUMENT command, type

     >DOCUMENT SUMMARY ALL<CR>

For more information, type EXAMPLE as soon as you see the >
prompt.

                                         BEGINNING
Syntax:   t->ITEM-INSERT  <line-number> <item-number> <items> <CR>
                                            END
Defaults:                   none         BEGINNING    none

     In the TEMPLATE-EDITOR, the ITEM-INSERT subcommand inserts a
list of items (separated by commas), within a template line. The
items can be added at the beginning or end of a line, or before
a specified item.  (Count items from beginning of line.)

(EXAMPLE exists.)
>EDIT SHORTY<CR>
t->SHOW<CR>
(1) Message-No: Subject:
(2) From: +
(3) Subject
t->ITEM-INSERT 1  2  Date<CR>
t->ITEM-INSERT 1  2  To+<CR>
t->SHOW<CR>
(1) Message-No:  Date:  Subject
(2) From:  To: +
(3) Subject:
   + causes a field to be printed (or otherwise       
   appear in an expanded form).
(Not available on TOPS-20)

Syntax: >JOBSTAT<CR>

     Jobstat prints on the User's terminal the TSS No. assigned,
the name of the LOGIN directory, and the terminal line.

Syntax:     >JUMP-TO <message-no.> <CR>

JUMP-TO changes the value of CMESSAGE to message-number but
causes no print-out.

The message-number must be a part of the CSEQUENCE.  The current
sequence, CSEQUENCE, is initially set to ALLMESSAGES or "*",
which consists of ALL the messages in the message-file.

(EXAMPLE exists.)
     >JUMP-TO 3<CR>
     >SHOW .<CR>
     CMESSAGE(=.) = 3
     >CONSIDER 10:20<CR>
     >JUMP-TO 5<CR>
     ? That msg not a member of CSEQUENCE
     >CONSIDER ALLMESSAGES<CR>
     >JUMP-TO 5<CR>
     >SHOW CMESSAGE<CR>
      CMESSAGE(=.) = 5
     ><LF>

The <LF> command now changes the CMESSAGE to 6 and then prints
that message on the terminal.
	
Syntax:      >>Keywords: <characters> <CR>
		
Keywords: is a LINE-TYPE field.  It accepts any characters,
and is terminated with a <CR>.

To continue to a another line, type a comma before the <CR>.


Hermes can be used to print mailing labels, or other pieces of
text that must be a fixed number of lines long.

  1. Set the terminal characteristics of the TENEX or TOPS-20 
     operating system.

     a) Set your terminal page length to desired over-all length,
        n, of the text plus blank lines.

        @TE LENGTH n

     b) Set your terminal to use its mechanical formfeed, if it
        has one, or to advance the proper number of spaces.

        @TE FORMFEED
        @TE NO INDICATE

     c) Set the terminal not to "page", i.e., not to stop after
        printing the number of lines set by the page length.

        @TE NO PAUSE END-OF-PAGE
		
  2. Create a template, and place the template item Separate: as 
     the last line.  A template for address labels might be:
	
     LABEL-TEMPLATE
     (1) Name:
     (2) Street:
     (3) City: ", " State: Zip:
     (4) Separate:
		
  3. Give the command:

     >PRINT msgs LABEL-TEMPLATE

     where msgs is the specification of the messages you wish to 
     use to print the labels.
   Create sequences of messages in your message-file.
   Sort sequences by fields such as ZIP.
   Select messages with fields that begin or end with a string by
   placing the | character at the beginning or end of the string.

For HERMES users who are remote from the lineprinter specified by
LINE-PRINTER on their host computer, the LIST and DOCUMENT
commands take a "current destination" named LDESTINATION.  The
LDESTINATION is initially set to LINE-PRINTER but it can be reset
by the command:

     >SET LDESTINATION TERMINAL<CR>
   Beginning with HERMES 4.1.12, Fcc fields are stored
   without version numbers in Fcc fields and in FDESTINATION
   and LDESTINATION.

<LF>   Line-feed key.  Prints the NEXT message on CSEQUENCE,
according to PTEMPLATE, on your terminal.

When CSEQUENCE is set to its initial setting of ALL the messages
in the message-file, <LF> increases the current message (the
CMESSAGE or ".") by one.  This allows you to step through your
message-file, reading your messages one by one.
                            BEGINNING
Syntax:     t->LINE-INSERT <line-number>  <CR>
                               END
Defaults:                   BEGINNING

     In the TEMPLATE-EDITOR, the LINE-INSERT subcommand
adds new lines to the template at either the beginning or the end
of the template, or before a specified line number.

     LINE-INSERT opens u the template at the beginning (before
line 1), before a specified line-no., or at the end.
The user enters template items, terminating with <CTRL-Z>.

(EXAMPLE exists.)
>CREATE TEMPLATE SHORTY<CR>
t->LINE-INSERT<CR>
(to ^Z)
MESSAGE-NO SUBJECT
TEXT
<CTRL-Z>^Z
t->SHOW<CR>
(1) Message-No: Subject:

t->LINE-INSERT 2<CR>
FROM +
<CTRL-Z>^Z
t->Show<CR>
(1) Message-No.: Subject:
(2) From: +
(3) Text:
t->

   + causes a field to be printed (or otherwise       
   appear in an expanded form).

When you request output to the system line-printer,
specify LINE-PRINTER if your FILENAME-INPUT-SWITCH is set to
"Hermes", or LPT: if the setting is "TENEX".

(EXAMPLE exists.)
If you want to print a survey on the system line-printer, type
     >SURVEY 1:125 <ESC>STEMPLATE LINE-PRINTER<CR>

          <name>
Syntax:   <name>-()     <one-line text>  <CR>
          <name>-(LINE)

     This is a one-Line text field, like the Subject:-field.  It
may contain any text and is terminated by a <CR>.  If you do not
specify the datatype of a user-field, LINE-type is assumed.

(EXAMPLE exists.)
>>PROVERB: Brevity is the soul of wit.<CR>
>>APHORISM-(): Infinite riches in a little room.<CR>
>>FULLNAME-(LINE): Douglas W. Dodds, Jr.<CR>

Settings:  LIST    ALL     LIST-FORM  LINE-PRINTER

LIST is used to produce copies of messages from your message-
file.  It first outputs a survey of all messages described by
the message specification, and then prints each of those
messages on a separate page.  Header-lines give the file-name
and date.

If you do not have access to a line-printer, set your
LDESTINATION to TERMINAL so that LIST will default to print
on your terminal.

(EXAMPLE exists.)
>LIST<CR>
     outputs to the line-printer, first a survey of the entire
     message-file (see SURVEY for an example) then a complete
     printout of all messages.

>LIST Subject: Weather<CR>
1,12:15,22
     prints on the lineprinter, first a survey of messages
     1,12:15 and 22, and then a copy of each message.  The
     message-nos. are displayed on your terminal.

Create predefined or "literal" fields in templates by
typing the word LITERAL, followed by a field name and then by
the contents of the field.  End with <CR> or <CTRL-Z>.

In PRINTING TEMPLATES, "literal" fields can be used
as alternatives to quoted strings.  The quoted strings must
be entered in the template one line at a time, which is
awkward when there are several lines to enter.  A literal
message-field makes it possible to enter several lines of
text as one field.

Only Text fields print as unlabelled pieces of text -- all
other fields include the field-name.  However, you can use
multiple Text fields in the same printing template.

In COMPOSING TEMPLATES, "literal" fields are included
in the completed message as if they had been typed in by the
user.  This is a good way of handling fields that you would
like to include in every message you send.
   Beginning with HERMS 4.1.12, literal Fcc fields are stored
   without version numbers.

Users who wish to login direct to Hermes should inform the staff
of the local host computer.

HERMES has been changed in HERMES 4.1.12 to provide the following
information to users who login directly:

1. Date and time of last previous login.

2. Date and time of next scheduled system downtime and planned
uptime.  (Downtime is the time when the system will shut down;
Uptime is the time when the system will come back into
operation.)

If no downtime is scheduled, there will be no notice.

3. You will see the message "[You have new mail.]" if there are
any new message in your Inbox.  This message will appear even if
your STARTWITHINBOX switch is set to NO, so that you do not
automatically GET your Inbox file, MESSAGE.TXT or MAIL.TXT.

4. You will see information about the disk allocation, i.e., the
amount of file storage that you are allowed:

     a) If you are over the working allocation.  In this case,
        you cannot delete messages.  HERMES warns you that you
        must delete entire message-files or draft-files.

     b) If you are under working allocation, but within 10
        pages of reaching the limit.  HERMES warns you, and 
        suggests that you delete and expunge messages.

When you LOGOUT, HERMES also gives disk allocation warnings, for
both login and connected directories.

ADVANTAGES OF DIRECT LOGIN:

1. If you use HERMES only, direct login saves you from dealing
with the TENEX or TOPS-20 system at all, especially if your
FILENAME-INPUT switch is set to HERMES, so that you can SHOW
MESSAGE-FILES and DRAFT-FILES from with HERMES, and can DELETE
files by using the MESSAGE-FILES and DRAFT-FILES editors.

2. If you use other programs on the system, but want to check
your messages frequently and avoid the startup time for HERMES,
direct login allows you to run HERMES in the top fork, and then
to run your other programs through a TENEX or TOPS-20 in a lower
fork under HERMES.
Syntax:   >LOGOUT<CR>

     LOGOUT is equivalent to QUIT plus TENEX/TOPS-20 LOGOUT.

If you log into Hermes directly, there is no operating system
above Hermes.  The QUIT command, if it does anything at all, must
also perform LOGOUT.  Should Hermes force you to use the LOGOUT
command only?  If you type QUIT --

     1.  Ask.  Hermes asks "Logout?"

     2.  Yes.  Hermes says "? Not possible; use Logout"

     3.  No.  Hermes performs LOGOUT without comment.

  LOGOUT-ONLY       [X]Ask           Yes           No

This fixed template displays a message exactly as received,
with the addition of a first line that contains information
generated when the message is received.
	
     LONG-PRINT-FORM
     (1) Message-No.:+ "; " Char-Count:+ Status:+ 
     (2) Verbatim: 

When you request output to the system line-printer, specify
LINE-PRINTER if your FILENAME-INPUT-SWITCH is set to
"Hermes", or LPT: if the setting is "TENEX".

(EXAMPLE exists.)
If you want to print a survey on the system line-printer, type
     >SURVEY 1:125 <ESC>STEMPLATE LPT:<CR>
 
The LTLE (Line at a Time, Local Echo) mode for Hermes is designed
to go into effect automatically whenever your terminal type is
set to HALFDUPLEX or LINE-HALFDUPLEX.
	
      @TERMINAL (TYPE IS) HALFDUPLEX<cr>
 
That is all you have to do; you do not need a special version,
and you do not have to give any commands or set any switches
within Hermes.  Hermes will sense the setting of your TENEX or
TOPS-20 terminal type and act accordingly.
 
The purpose of the LTLE mode is to allow Hermes to operate
efficiently over a packet radio network, or over any packet-
switch network, such as the ARPAnet or Telenet.  At the same
time, LTLE Hermes preserves enough of the normal Hermes style of
rapid interaction to keep the user interface familar and pleasant.
 
NEWHERMES 4.3.3 contains fixes for some problems that have been
reported by the Packet Radio people on ISID.
 
    1)  Delete-line (^U) no longer attempts to erase what it
        can't from the screen; it just gives "XXX<cr>" and let
        it go at that.  Note that if your TERMINAL-TYPE is set
        as any kind of screen terminal, Delete-char (<DEL>) and
        Delete-word (^W) still erases, since they can believe
        they are still on the same terminal line (assuming,
        always, that the user waits, to maintain sync).
 
    2)  The echoing and the conditional-newline routines have
        been adjusted so that the LTLE user does not get excess
        linefeeds when he types a <CR>.
 
    3)  LTLE users have reported peculiar terminal behavior in
        a lower EXEC under HERMES.  We have only an approximate
        description of this problem, and no live means of
        testing.  We hope we have solved it by the adjustment
        in (2), plus the fact that startup control character
        output settings are now carefully passed through.
        Please send reports about what happens.
 
    4)  One other issue was raised by the reports from ISID:
        What should we do about absorbing or rejecting changes
        in terminal duplexity?  There is no obvious answer to
        part of this question; rather an agreement is needed on
        how HERMES is to behave.  We will propose a design to
        address this matter in the near future.
 
(Type EXAMPLE for a technical discussion of the design of the
LTLE-compatible mode.)
     The following are the elements of the design of the LTLE-
     compatible mode in HERMES:
     1)  HERMES must read, save and act on the duplex bits in
         the terminal JFN Mode Word.  If the setting is Line
         Halfduplex, HERMES must operate in LTLE-compatible
         mode.
     2)  Lower processes (e.g.  EMACS) may change the duplex
         bits, so HERMES must save and restore them after
         return from any lower process.
     3)  HERMES must suppress generation of any echoes,
         either by the monitor (by the echo mode setting in
         the JFN Mode Word) or by itself.
     4)  HERMES must force the setting of the SPACE-FUNCTION
         and CR-FUNCTION switches to Recognize (i.e.  don't
         fill in completions).  If HERMES does this, there is
         no need to alter PRNET users' profiles.
     5)  When LTLE is set, HERMES gathers passwords (for
         connecting) and for encryption keys by first setting
         the terminal to full duplex, gathering the input
         with echoing turned off (as is always done), and
         finally restoring the terminal to line-halfduplex
         mode.
     6)  In LTLE mode, address-field input must deal with
         errors quite differently from its familiar rapidly
         interactive style.  Successful address corrections
         are not reported at all, and bad addresses are
         reported only when the line is terminated.  When a
         line of address input contains one or more errors,
         then, the user sees no error messages until a break
         character is given; following a break, all error
         messages appear, followed by a retype of the line,
         to show what remains in it.  Also, if the break was
         a <CR>, the user is prompted for a continuation
         line, in order to most easily correct or reenter
         erroneous addresses.
     7)  In LTLE mode, command line error routines, which may
         be detecting errors near the beginning of a long
         stream of input, must take care to clear all pending
         input after reporting the error and retyping the
         command to the point of the error.  This may throw
         away a great deal of user input, but such must be
         assumed to be invalid if it was given before the
         error message was output.  To summarize the whole
         scheme for application of command-line spelling
         correction under LTLE:
        a)  If CORRECT-INPUT is set to NO, all command line
            errors are treated as in full duplex operation,
            with the addition that following input is
            cleared.
        b)  Any error to which spelling correction cannot be
            made is also treated as usual.
        c)  A correctable error terminated by a break
            character has the usual full duplex correction
            protocol applied.
        d)  A correctable error terminated by a non-break is
            corrected, the correction is written into the
            line buffer, and a flag is set.  Further parsing
            of the line will notice that flag, and:
           (1)  on a later error, no correction is
                attempted, the second error is diagnosed,
                the line is retyped (revealing the earlier
                correction) and the flag is cleared.  Else,
                if no later error occurs:
           (2)  on the confirming <CR>, the flag is
                cleared, the line retyped (showing
                correction), and a confirmation is prompted
                from the user.

The fields Mail-From: and Received-Date: are appended to messages
when they are deilvered either by Hermes (for direct delivery) or
by the most recent version of the TENEX or TOPS-20 delivery
programs.

Older versions of TENEX and TOPS-20 delivery programs append the
line

     Mail from <host> rcvd on <date> <time>

The change was made for the purpose of conforming to RFC733
standards for ARPAnet messages.  RFC733 requires that header
fields consist of a name, followed by a colon, followed by the
contents of the field, i.e.,
	
Mail-From: BBNA
Received-Date: 19-Feb-80 1234-EST
  Template item that prints the date the message was received.
Syntax: >MAILER<CR>

     The HERMES command MAILER forces immediate delivery of any
messages queued BY SEND, and prints out a status report of the
TENEX or TOPS-20  MAILER and the subsystem queue.  You can check
up on queued and undeliverable mail with MAILSTAT.

Syntax:   >MAILSTAT <directory><CR>
Defaults:             LOGIN

<directory> may be LOGIN or CONNECTED.

Mailstat lists queued and undeliverable messages; allows you to
manipulate undeliverable messages.

If undeliverable mail exists, MAILSTAT automatically enters you
into a set of subcommands, similar to an editor.

Subcommands (ms-> prompt):
DONE                  Makes changes final.  Returns to >.
ABORT                 Aborts changes.  Returns to >.
DELETE            no. Deletes undeliverable message.  Specify by
                       undeliverable message no.
NO-ACTION-FOR     no. Cancels previous subcommand.
PRINT             no. Prints message on your terminal.
READDRESS&REQUEUE no. Prompts you for a new addressee, then queues
                       message for MAILER.
SHOW                  Shows undeliverable messages.

                             REMIND
                             NOREMIND

Default:          CMESSAGE   none

MARK changes the status of messages in your file.

(EXAMPLE exists.)
| When you MARK a message REMIND, it appears every time
| you GET the file, in the initial survey.  You can "forget"
| a message by marking it SEEN.
|
|     >MARK 6 REMIND<CR>
|     >MARK 11 SEEN<CR>
   DELETE = MARK DELETED; UNDELETE = MARK UNDELETED
   Marks messages with *. REMIND messages appear in each
   intial survey.

When you use the EXCHANGE command, should the system match
the case (upper or lower) of each letter in the "old string"?
(The usual Hermes searches do not match cases, i.e., are
case-insensitive.)

  MATCH-CASE           Ask       [X]Yes          No

To override this switch, type ",<CR>" instead of "<CR>" to
end the EXCHANGE command.  Type ? to +> prompt to see the
override commands.  End override mode by typing <CR> to +>
prompt.

The formfeed, or "new-page", character is CTRL-L.  It is
generated by the "Separate:" template item, and at some
places in the output of the DOCUMENT command.

At the request of users who have terminals with mechanical
formfeeds, the CTRL-L is passed through to the terminal, in
the form controlled by the terminal characteristics set in
the TENEX/TOPS-20 operating system.

Set the terminal characteristics with the following commands:

TENEX:    @FORMFEED             or    @NO INDICATE

TOPS-20:  @TERMINAL FORMFEED    or    @TERMINAL NO INDICATE

Hermes also is transparent to the "tab", CTRL-I.
	
Syntax:      >>Message-Class: <characters> <CR>
		
Message-Class: is a LINE-TYPE field.  It accepts any characters,
and is terminated with a <CR>.

To continue to a another line, type a comma before the <CR>.

Hermes acts upon one message-file at a time for reading 
messages.  You can change the current message-file with the
GET command.

Basic Commands (> prompt):
FILE      msg file    Copies messages into another file.
GET       file        Changes the current message-file.

Advanced Commands (> prompt):
MOVE      msg file    Duplicate of FILE.
UNGET     ---         Removes the current message-file; does
                       not substitute another message-file.

The operating system provides one permanent message-file in each
directory; this is your Inbox, the place where messages are
received.  Create other message-files with FILE or MOVE.

If your FILENAME-INPUT switch is set to HERMES --

  1) HERMES recognises message-files as files with a special kind
     of TENEX/TOPS-20 file-name: NAME.TXT;1 on TENEX and
     NAME.TXT.1 on TOPS-20.

  2) File-names are displayed as single words.  For example, your
     Inbox is MESSAGE on TENEX host computers or MAIL on TOPS-20.
     File-names may contain upper-case letters, numbers, or -.

  3) The command SHOW MESSAGE-FILES displays a list of all the
     message-files in your directory.  Or type GET ?

  4) You can get rid of message-files by using the DELETE command
     in the MESSAGE-FILES editor.  Type EDIT MESSAGE-FILES. This
     automatically gets rid of the companion "parseq" files.

If your FILENAME-INPUT switch is set to TENEX or TOPS-20 --

  1) All filenames are displayed in the operating system form,
     e.g., MESSAGE.TXT;1 on TENEX or MAIL.TXT.1 on TOPS-20.

  2) On TENEX, you may use the DIRECTORY command at either the >
     or @ prompt to show all the files in your directory; on
     TOPS-20, DIRECTORY is available only at the @ prompt.

  3) You must use the TENEX/TOPS-20 DELETE command at the @
     prompt to get rid of message-files and parseq files.

The name of a file in any directory other than your connected
directory consists of the name of the directory, enclosed in
angle brackets, followed by the name of the file:
     <JONES>SAVED-MSGS for HERMES file-names
     <JONES>SAVED-MSGS.TXT;1 for TENEX file-names
     <JONES>SAVED-MSGS.TXT.1 for TOPS-20 file-names.

The MESSAGE-FILES-EDITOR is available only if the FILENAME-INPUT
switch is set to HERMES.

The MESSAGE-FILES editor displays message-files only but deletes
both message-files and their companion parseq files.  The DRAFT-
FILES editor displays draft-files only.

To display any other files in your directory, PUSH to the @
prompt and use the TENEX/TOPS-20 command DIRECTORY.

Commands (> prompt):
EDIT MESSAGE-FILES  Enters the MESSAGE-FILES editor.
EDIT DRAFT-FILES    Enters the DRAFT-FILES editor.

Subcommands (m-> or d-> prompt):
ABORT               Aborts deletions.  Returns to >.
DONE                Permanently deletes and expunges files.
                     Returns to >.
DELETE   file       Marks file to be deleted.
UNDELETE file       Removes marks for deletion.
SHOW                Shows list of files.

When you SEND a message, Hermes constructs a unique
Message-ID field of the form:

     Message-ID: <[HOST] 6-Feb-78 01:23:45.LOGIN>

HOST is the name of the host computer.  The date is the date
sent, the time is the time sent in hours, minutes and
second, and LOGIN is the your login directory.  (In this
case, the angle brackets are "real", and not a convention, as
in the Syntax lines of other topics.)
Basic Commands (> prompt):
DELETE    msg         Deletes messages.
UNDELETE  msg         Restores deleted messages.
EXPUNGE               Permanently removes deleted messages.
                       Renumbers the message-file.

Advanced Command (> prompt):
MARK     msg status   Marks messages SEEN, UNSEEN, DELETED 
                       UNDELETED, REMIND or NOREMIND.

The Message-No.  of a message is the position of the message
in the message-file.  When messages are deleted and then
expunged, the file is rewritten, the expunged messages are
removed, and the message-nos.  are changed.

SEQUENCES are lists of message-nos.  They are automatically
updated when messages are deleted and expunged.
In ANY command that allows you to type in message specifications
("msg" or "(messages)") you  can combine selection specifications
with four operators , / ; and NOT.  Assume you have 20 messages,
and nos.  5, 10, 15 and 20 are from Jones.

COMMA:  The "," operator builds up specifications.  If the
   parts of the specification are separated by ",", HERMES
   selects the messages that fit any one.  Duplicates are
   removed.  This is the "union" operation.
   Ex.: SURVEY FROM JONES, 1:10  selects  5,10,15,20,1:4,6:9

SLASH:  The "/" narrows down specifications.  The specifica-
   tion after the "/" place a restriction on anything before
   the "/".  Message-nos. cannot be used after "/".
   Ex.: PRINT 1:10/FROM JONES  selects  5,10

SEMICOLON:  The ";" closes a specification and starts a new one.
   The action of "/" stops at the preceding ";".
   Ex.: PRINT 12:22,1:10/FROM JONES   prints  15,20,5,10
   but  PRINT 12:22;1:10/FROM JONES   prints  12:22,5,10

NOT:  The "NOT" selects messages that do NOT fit the
   specifications.  
   >SURVEY NOT FROM JONES   surveys 1:4,6:9,11:14,16:19
   >LIST 1:10/NOT FROM JONES   lists 1:4,6:9
   >CONSIDER 5:15   sets CSEQUENCE = 5:15
   >PRINT CSEQUENCE/NOT FROM JONES   prints 6:9,11:14

Just to keep things from being too complicated, between two
"/" or  "NOT" operators, "," acts like a ";".  Assume that
sequence EIGHT-TEN contains messages 8, 9 and 10.
   >LIST 1:5/FROM JONES,5:15/EIGHT-TEN lists 5,8:10
   >LIST 1:5/FROM JONES,5:15/NOT EIGHT-TEN  lists 5,15
   >LIST 1:5/FROM JONES,NOT EIGHT-TEN  lists 5,1:4,6,7,11:20
In a file of 20 messages, message nos. 5,10,15,20 are
from JONES and 2,4,6,12,14,16 are from SMITH:

      >SURVEY FROM JONES,FROM SMITH, 15:20
            selects 5,10,15,20,2,4,6,12,14,16:20

      >PRINT FROM JONES/FROM SMITH
            selects nothing.

      >LIST 15:20/FROM SMITH
            selects 16

      >FILE 15:20/FROM SMITH;1:10/FROM JONES
            selects 16,5,10

      >DELETE FROM SMITH
            selects 2,4,6,12,14,16

      >UNDELETE ALLMESSAGES/FROM SMITH
            selects 2,4,6,12,14,16

      >MOVE NOT FROM SMITH
            selects 1,3,5,7:11,13,15,17:20

      >CONSIDER 10:15
            sets CSEQUENCE to 10:15

      >SURVEY FROM SMITH
            selects CSEQUENCE/FROM SMITH = 12,14

In ANY command that prompts you for one or more message-nos., by
printing "(messages)" when you hit the <esc> key, you can use a
a variety of specifications for selecting messages to act on.

1) A list or range of message-nos.
      1,3,5,8:10 (Note that 8:10 = 8,9,10 and 10:8 = 10,9,8)

2) A symbol or name for a message or sequence of messages
      .  or  CMESSAGE    = the current message
      *  or  ALLMESSAGES = all messages in a message-file
      %  or  LASTMESSAGE = the last message in a file 
             (also the last line in a field in the CDRAFT, and the
             last line in a template in the TEMPLATE-EDITOR, etc.)
                                                                 
3) <CTRL-P> re-enters the PREVIOUSSEQUENCE (i.e., the set of
      messages most recently specified in ANY command),
      then closes the (messages) part of the command.

4) A SEQUENCE.  This is a list of message-numbers that is
      stored under a name.
      Ex.: CSEQUENCE, RECENTMESSAGES, PREVIOUSSEQUENCE,
           or any user-created sequence.
1&2) A message-no. or range of message-nos.:
     CMESSAGE or "."
     LASTMESSAGE or "%"

          >PRINT %<CR>
          >SURVEY .<CR>
          >FILE 5<CR>
          >PRINT 11:8<CR>  where 11:8 = 11,10,9,8
          >SURVEY 25:%<CR>

4) A sequence.

          >PRINT *<CR>
          >FILE PREVIOUSSEQUENCE (on file) OLDMAIL<CR>
          >SURVEY URGENT<CR>, where URGENT is a sequence.

   How to combine message specifications.

This is an example of the basic Hermes message, composed with the
COMPOSE-FORM template and printed through the LONG-PRINT-FORM
template.  Hermes messages may contain header fields other than
the ones shown here.

                                                              _ 
Message 228;  1217 chars RECENT                                |
Mail from BBN-TENEXE rcvd at 12-Nov-78 1024-EST                |
Date: 12 Nov 1978 1024-EST                                     |
Sender: MOOERS at BBN-TENEXE                                Header
Subject: Demonstration message.                             Fields
From: MOOERS at BBN-TENEXE                                     |
To: JMILLER at BBN-TENEXA                                      |
Cc: Mooers                                                     |
Message-ID: <[BBN-TENEXE]12-Nov-78 10:24:52.MOOERS>           _|
                                                              _ 
This is the multi-line Text: field, which usually contains     |
the body of the message.                                       |
                                                               |
Most messages, when they are composed as drafts, contain just  |
the To:, Cc:, Subject: and Text: fields.                       |
                                                               |
When the message is sent and received, a number of other       |
header fields are added, as you can see in this example.       |
                                                               |
The first line of the header shows three "pseudo-fields"       |
computed by Hermes when the message was received.              |
                                                             Text:
Message-No      The position of the message in the file.       |
Char-count      The number of characters in the message.       |
Status          Flags message that are UNSEEN and/or RECENT.   |
                                                               |
The second header line, "Mail from ..." was added by the       |
network program that delivers messages, or, if the message     |
bypasses the network, by the sender's Hermes.  The             |
recipient's Hermes uses this line to compute the "pseudo-      |
field" Rcvd-Date, which is used in the SURVEY-FORM template.   |
                                                               |
The third and following header lines show the message as it    |
was originally composed.  Fields  added automatically by the   |
the sender's Hermes are Sender:, From:, Date: and Message-ID. _| 
   The current draft message in the DRAFT-EDITOR.
   Parts of the message; usually HEADERS (or header fields) and Text.
   Filled in when the message is sent and received.
   Supplied by HERMES and filled in by the user.
   Field names created by the user; four possible datatypes.

The following one, two, and three-character symbols have special
functions in the HERMES System:
      * % / \ - + ^ S P D Q

Syntax:   >MOVE <messages>  <message-file> <CR>
Defaults:        CSEQUENCE   FDESTINATION
Initial
Settings:           ALL        [Empty]

     MOVE places copies of messages from the currently active
message-file into some other message-file.  If the specified file
exits, the messages are appended to its present contents.  If the
message-file does not yet exist, it is created at this time.

HERMES asks whether to delete the filed messages from the
current message-file.

FILE and MOVE are identical, but have independent switches.

(EXAMPLE exists.)
>MOVE FROM: JONES;/FROM: SMITH/TO: JONES JONES-MSGS<CR>
     [Old version]<CR>
Delete messages after filing? Yes<CR>
12,14,18:20,45,56:58,75,88
All correspondence between Smith and Jones is transferred to
JONES-MSGS.

When you FILE or MOVE a message should the original message be
deleted?

      FILE-DELETE       [X]Ask           Yes          No
      MOVE-DELETE       [X]Ask           Yes          No

To override these switches, type ",<CR>" instead of "<CR>" to
end the FILE or MOVE command.  Type ? to +> prompt to see the
override commands.  End override mode by typing <CR> to +>.

The SORT command can be used to perform multiple sorts,
with the convention that  the "inner" sorts be accomplished
first.

SORT is also a subcommand of the SEQUENCE-EDITOR.
(EXAMPLE exists.)
It is often convenient to  sort  a  message  file  by  author,
with  the messages  from each author arranged by date.  To do
this sort first by DATE then by FROM:

>CREATE SEQUENCE FROMDATE<CR>
s->ADD ALL<CR>
s->SHOW<CR>
1:16
s->DONE<CR>
>SORT FROMDATE DATE<CR>
s->SHOW<CR>
2,1,3:12,14,13,15,16
>SORT FROMDATE FROM<CR>
>SHOW FROMDATE<CR>
1,9,6,10,8,2,3,11,4,13,5,7,12,14:16

Syntax:     >>NETED  <field-name><CR>
Default:                 Text:

     NETED is a standard Tenex editor, available in the HERMES
DRAFT-EDITOR.

NOTE: If you get into NETED by mistake, <CTRL-C> will get you
back to the HERMES >> without loss.

NETED creates an "inferior fork" of TENEX NETED, that is, a
copy of NETED inside HERMES, with the specified field of the
message in the NETED buffer.  You may then use all of the
available NETED commands to edit the field.

Return to HERMES by typing
     Quit<CR>

HERMES prints: "Replace the Text field?" or whatever field has
been edited.

If you respond to  by typing <CR> or Y<CR>, HERMES inserts the
edited version of the buffer as the new message field.

If you type N<CR>, the edited version of the buffer disappears,
and HERMES does not change the contents of the message field.

In either case, you are returned to the DRAFT-EDITOR.

You can also return to HERMES by typing
     SAVE <file-name><CR>

This command creates a TENEX file containing copy of the buffer,
then executes the NETED command Quit.

     As with TECO, XED and SPELL, we assume you know how to use
NETED before you invoke this command.  (See the TENEX USERS'
GUIDE (Jan 75 edition), Network section, page 258.)

(EXAMPLE exists.)
>>NETED<CR>
Edit.
*Quit<CR>
Replace the Text field? Yes<CR>
>>

This template item is for use in printing templates only.

NEVER-DASHED-TEXT prints the Text: field but suppresses any
number of lines of seven dashes at the end of the Text:
field, if there are any.
   Prints Text field, then always prints one line of dashes.
   Prints the Text: field exactly as received. May be used in
   composing templates.

When they are shown in columns, almost all responses to ? or to
a SHOW NAMES command fit inside a single screen of a CRT display.

NOTE: Can you find one that doesn't, and that doesn't involve
large numbers of user-created objects?	If so, send a SUGGESTION
message!

The Hermes DESCRIBE topics have not been updated since HERMES
4.1.18 (released in August 1981).  New features for NEWHERMES
4.3.3 (April 1982), and HERMES 4.2.2 (January 1982) are
described briefly in the Related Topics, listed below.	For a
full description, type

    >DESCRIBE <topic> <CR>

To see complete descriptions of all new features, type

    >DESCRIBE NEW-FEATURES ALL <CR>

This prints out the topic "NEW-FEATURES" and its subtopics.
If you have access to the line-printer for your host computer,
you can type

    >DOCUMENT NEW-FEATURES ALL <CR>
   The new EDITOR interface puts the whole draft into an editor
   and lets you move the cursor from field to field.  It is
   especially useful for screen-oriented editors such as EMACS.
   Also see the file WHOLEDRAFT-HERMES.DOC in the HERMES
   directory. COPY this booklet to the lineprinter with the
   TENEX or TOPS-20 command:
 @COPY <HERMES>WHOLEDRAFT-HERMES.DOC LPT:<cr>
(Known bug: If you explode a message and edit it in the EDITOR
interface style, Hermes "forgets" the message-number of the
exploded message.  This will be fixed shortly.)
   ASK: "Editor or Command-line?"
   EDITOR: Places entire current draft (CDRAFT) in editor.
   COMMAND-LINE:  Same old Hermes.  (Initial setting.)
   Sets the default editor to EMACS, TECO, TV, WE, XED or none.
   First time, EMACS asks if you want NOVICE mode. At end of
   edit, only the *Hermes* buffer is transferred to the CDRAFT.
   New switch for people who want delete a message AFTER the
   reply to the message has been sent.
   ASK: "Delete replied-to message after REPLY?"
   YES: Delete the replied-to message automatically.
   NO:  Leave the message undeleted, as in the past.
(Note: To avoid confusion, the name of the REPLY-ERASE switch
has been changed to ERASE-BEFORE-REPLYING.  The names of the
COMPOSE-ERASE and FORWARD-ERASE have not been changed.  These
switches control whether the current draft (CDRAFT) is erased
before the REPLY, COMPOSE or FORWARD command takes effect.)
   Techniques for searching the current sequence (CSEQUENCE) in
   commands such as SURVEY now allow you to search for a string
   at the beginning or end of a field, by using the | character.
   To search for "|" itself, use quotes.
   User-created fields with the form NAME-(number), Name-(no.),
   NAME-(#) or name-($).  These fields accept integer and
   decimal numbers, and numbers containing exponents, in the
   form <num>E<exp>, where <exp> is an integer and the total
   value is between -1.7E38 and +1.7E38. Numeric fields
   sort by numerical value, and may be selected with the
   relationships "GreaterThan", "LessThan" and "EqualTo".
   The LTLE (Line at a Time, Local Echo) mode allows efficient 
   transmission over a packet radio network.  Bugs in the
   experimental LTLE-HERMES have been fixed.
   Hermes can SURVEY deleted messages, but only if all
   the messages specified are deleted.  (4.2.2)
   Hermes now includes host names in all addressee fields.
   Improved searching for addressee fields.  (4.2.2)
   This new template item, for use with the Xerox Penguin
   printer, starts messages on new sheets of paper.  (4.2.2)
   New features introduced in Hermes 4.1.18, August 1981.

The template item "New-Sheet-of-Paper:" is designed for use with
the Xerox Penguin printer, modified by the Information Sciences
Institute of the University of Southern California (ISI).

At present, this printer is available only on ISI hosts.  When
used in a printing template, and specifically in the LTEMPLATE,
which is the default for the LIST command, "New-Sheet-of-Paper"
causes the text that follows to begin at the top of a new sheet
of paper.  If necessary, it will leave the back of the current
page blank.

The detailed explanation of this feature is included in the NEWS
only on the ISI host computers that use this printer.  If any
other site acquires the same or similar printer, please send a
message to HERMES at BBNA, or write to the HERMES Project, Bolt
Beranek and Newman, Inc., 10 Moulton Street, Cambridge, MA 02238,
or telephone 617-497-3654.

Syntax:  > NEWMAIL <CR>
Syntax:       NEWS <destination><CR>
Defaults:              TTY:

     The NEWS command provides users with information about
modifications to the HERMES system.  Headlines are displayed
sequentially and for each, the user can decide whether or not to
have the associated story printed.

     In addition to NEWS, NEW-FEATURES of the HERMES system are
available using the normal documentation commands DESCRIBE,
OUTLINE, EXAMPLE, and DOCUMENT.  Additions to the HERMES Users'
Guide as well as very recent material are available as subtopics
of New-Features.  To obtain a complete list, type:
     >OUTLINE NEW-FEATURES ALL<CR>

If your UPDATE-PROFILE switch is set to NO or ASK, you can be
selective about which objects get stored in your Profile.

You can move objects back and forth between the Active
Environment and the Profile by means of the EXPORT and IMPORT
commands.

You can enter the PROFILE-EDITOR with the command EDIT PROFILE.
When you are working in the PROFILE-EDITOR (with the double-arrow
prompt), EXPORT copies an object from the Profile to the Active
Environment.  Similarly, IMPORT copies from the Active
Environment to the Profile.

When your UPDATE-PROFILE switch is set to "No", you can create
objects in the Active Environment, but they will disappear at the
end of the HERMES session.  If you want to keep any object
permanently, you must store the object in the Profile with the
EXPORT command.

(EXAMPLE exists.)
The UPDATE-PROFILE switch is set to NO, and you have created
two new templates, SCRAMBLED-FORM and SHORT-FORM, in your
Active Environment.

          >EXPORT SCRAMBLED-FORM PTEMPLATE<CR>
          >EXPORT SHORT-FORM <ESC> SHORT-FORM<CR>

You have now placed the contents of SCRAMBLED-FORM in the
PTEMPLATE in the Profile, and the contents of SHORT-FORM in a
User-defined template, also named SHORT-FORM, in the Profile.

The PTEMPLATE in the Active Environment is unchanged.  If you now
Quit HERMES and the re-enter through the command

          @HERMES<CR>

you will find that the Active Environment has become a copy of
your Profile. Your PTEMPLATE, in both the Active Environment and
the Profile, is a copy of the old template SCRAMBLED-FORM. But
SCRAMBLED-FORM no longer exists as a Used-defined, named
template.

               BEFORE QUITTING     AFTER RE-ENTRY

PTEMPLATE      Initial setting:    Contents of SCRAMBLED-FORM

SCRAMBLED-FORM Exists in Active    Does not exist in Active
               Environment.        Environment or Profile.

SHORT-FORM     Exists in Active    Exists in Active
               Environment and     Environment and
               in Profile.         in Profile.

Nonprinting characters are typed by special keys on your
terminal.  All have special control functions in the HERMES
Message System.

"NOT" can be used in message specifications, along with ",",
"/" and ";".  The "NOT" selects messages that do NOT fit the
specifications.  The action of "NOT" does not extend right
past a comma.

EXAMPLE exists.
Suppose you have 20 messages in your message-file, and 
4,9,14 and 19 are from Jones.

   >SURVEY NOT FROM JONES      surveys 1:3,5:9,11:13,15:18,20
   >LIST 1:10/NOT FROM JONES   lists 1:3,5:8,10
   >CONSIDER 5:15              sets CSEQUENCE = 5:15
   >PRINT /NOT FROM JONES      prints 5:8,10:13,15

Exception:  Between two "/" or  "NOT" operators, "," acts like
;".  Assume sequence EIGHT-TEN contains nos. 8:10.

   >LIST 1:5/FROM JONES,5:15/EIGHT-TEN      lists 4,8:10
   >LIST 1:5/FROM JONES,5:15/NOT 8:10       lists 4:7,11:15
   >LIST 1:5/FROM JONES,NOT EIGHT-TEN       lists 4,1:3,5:7,11:20

You can use a single message-no. or range of message-nos.
after "NOT", but the action of "NOT" does not extend right
past a comma.

   >SURVEY NOT 8:10           surveys 1:7,11:20
   >SURVEY NOT 8,9,10         surveys 1:7,10:20
NUMERIC-type fields are user-created fields of the form:
Name-(number), Name-(no.), Name-(#) or Name-($).

Each of these fields accepts one number only (similar to a
DATE-type field).  The number may be minus or plus, and may be an
integer, a decimal number, or a number written with an exponent,
e.g.  1.45E7, where the exponent following the "E" is an integer
and the total number lies between approximately -1.7E38 and +1.7E38.

NUMERIC-type fields sort by numeric value, and may be selected
with the relationships "GreaterThan", "LessThan" and "EqualTo".
USER-FIELDS

The DONE command makes permanent the editing changes made in
the object-editor.  The ABORT command aborts the editing
session and leaves the object as it was.

The documentation commands DESCRIBE, EXAMPLE, OUTLINE and
DOCUMENT default to an appropriate topic in each editor.

Each of the editors has a distinctive prompt and a set of
specialized commands.

obj = object; dst = destination (TTY:, LPT: or file)
   Comparison of commands in all editors except DRAFT-EDITOR.

Objects are special structures which can be used in HERMES.
Several commands for printing and composing messages, like PRINT,
SURVEY and COMPOSE, allow you to choose one or more objects of a
specific type.  The object types are Sequence, Filter, Template,
and Destination.  Individual objects may be CREATEd, EDITed or
SET.  They may also be used with SHOW.


Hermes also has a few "collectve objects.  These are single
objects that contain some sort of collection.  The most important
is the current draft, CDRAFT; others are SWITCHES, USER-FIELDS,
MESSAGE-FILES, DRAFT-FILES, the PROFILE and the
RECORD-OF-MESSAGE-FILES.  These objects may used at top command
level only as part of the SHOW or EDIT commands.
   SWITCHES control the user interface to Hermes.  They set
   the way many commands and other features work.
   The PROFILE stores the settings of your SWITCHES and your filters
   filters, templates, user-fields and destinations.
   The current draft message.

The "Other:" template item prints any fields in a incoming
message that would not be printed by other items in the
STANDARD template.

In the current version of HERMES, the "Mail from ..."  line
appended to incoming messages is printed by the Other: item.

(EXAMPLE exists.)
     >SHOW OTHER-DEMO-TEMPLATE<CR>
     (1) Msg-No: +
     (2) Other:

Syntax:   OUTLINE      <topic>       <depth>  <destination>  <CR>
Defaults:         INTRODUCING-HERMES*   1         TTY:

The OUTLINE command prints an outline of any HERMES topic to
a user-specified depth. The outline is printed on the specified
destination.

* NOTE: In the DRAFT-EDITOR and other editors, <topic> defaults
  to different topics, appropriate to the editor.

(EXAMPLE exists.)
>OUTLINE TEMPLATES
     Produces a three-level outline of the topic "TEMPLATES" on
     your terminal.
>OUTLINE INTRODUCING-HERMES ALL LPT:
     Produces an outline of all HERMES topics on the line-printer.

If a message field appears alone on a template line, the
output of the field is carried ove to any many lines as are
needed.  If more than one item appears on a line, the output
may be restricted to just one line, and the item that
overflows the line may be truncated, according to the
following rules:
	
1) A field is not truncated if there is only one item on the
   template line.

2) A field is not truncated if the other items on the
   template line are all quoted strings.

3) To cause truncation under conditions (1) or (2), begin the
   line with the special symbol "".

4) When two or more items are placed in a single template
   line, the second item is printed at the end of the first
   line of the first item.

   Thus, if the template line contains To:, followed by Subject:,
   a multi-line To: field no longer necessarily blocks the
   printing of the Subject field.

5) If the template line contains two or more fields, or
   similar items such as Message-No, Status, Char-count or
   Source, the output line is automatically truncated.

This is why the Subject: often appears chopped-off in messages
surveyed through SURVEY-FORM.  To guarantee full output, 
Subject: could be placed on a separate line:
	
     (1) Status Message-No. ":  " Char-Count Rcvd-Date Source
     (2) Subject:
		
If you would like to indent the Subject:, you can now do so
without truncating the Subject: field.
	
     (1) Status Message-No. ":  " Char-Count Rcvd-Date Source
     (2) "       " Subject:
		
However, the second line of a multiline Subject field is not
indented.

For obvious reasons, it is almost always desirable to place the
Text: field on a separate template line.

              or TOPS-20.  Return to Hermes by typing CONTINUE
              to the @ prompt.  Typing SUSPEND at > prompt is
              safer.  WARNING: In Teco, Xed, Neted or We,

!            Allows you to "escape" from HERMES filenames, and
              type in a file with an extension other than TXT
              (for message-files) or HRM (For draft-files).
              You must type ! before you begin the filename.
HERMES automatically creates for each message-file, a companion
file called the "parseq" file, which contains the "PARse" of the
file (information used in searching messages) and any SEQuences
you have created.

The parseq files are not displayed by the SHOW MESSAGE-FILES
command; you can see them only by using the TENEX/TOPS-20 command
DIRECTORY at the > or @ prompt on TENEX or at the @ prompt only
on TOPS-20.

The parseq file for MESSAGE.TXT;1 is ^MESSAGE.TXT^;1, and for
MAIL.TXT.1 is ^MAIL.TXT^.1.

The MESSAGE-FILES editor automatically deletes the parseq file
when a message-file is deleted.  If you delete a message-file at
the @ prompt, you must remember to delete the parseq file also.
Type <CTRL-V> before "^" on TOPS-20.  You may also use the
RECORD-OF-MESSAGE-FILES editor to delete leftover parseq files.
	
Syntax:      >>Precedence: <characters> <CR>
		
Precedence: is a LINE-TYPE field.  It accepts any characters,
and is terminated with a <CR>.

To continue to a another line, type a comma before the <CR>.


Syntax:   PRINT <messages> <template> <destination> <CR>
Defaults:        CMESSAGE   PTEMPLATE   TERMINAL
 Initial         "message
Settings:         before    PRINT-FORM  TERMINAL
                  RECENT"

PRINT is used to produce copies of messages from your
message file.  It prints all specified messages on the
destination you specify.

After a PRINT command is executed, the last message printed
becomes the current message.

(EXAMPLE exists.)
>PRINT 1                 prints message number 1 from your
                         message-file on your terminal.

>PRINT 2:5,10            prints messages 2,3,4,5 and 10.

>PRINT FROM: LEVIN FANCY LINE-PRINTER
                         prints all messages from Levin using
                         the FANCY template.  The messages
                         are printed on the line printer.
   One-letter synonym for PRINT.
The printing commands PRINT and SURVEY produce output on 
your terminal.  The LIST command produces output on your
Line-Printer, if one is available.  THe FORWARD and INCLUDE
commands "print" into the text field of your draft message.

The form of the "printed" output is specified by a printing
template.  Each command defaults to its own "current
template".  The contents of the current templates can be
changed by you.  You can override the current template by
typing the name of a different template after the message
specification, or after the FCTEMPLATE in the FORWARD
command.

          Ex.: >PRINT 3 LONG-PRINT-FORM<CR>
               >FORWARD 3:5 FCTEMPLATE PRINT-FORM<CR>

Current:          EDIT contents, or set with SET.
 PTEMPLATE        Default for the PRINT command; initially
                   set to PRINT-FORM.
 STEMPLATE        Default for the SURVEY command; initially 
                   set to SURVEY-FORM.
 LTEMPLATE        Default for the LIST command; initially set
                   to LIST-FORM.
 ITEMPLATE        Default for the INCLUDE command;  controls
                   format of included message; initially set 
                   to INCLUDE-FORM.
 FITEMPLATE       Second default template for the FORWARD
                   commands; controls format of forwarded
                   messages; initially set to INCLUDE-FORM.

TEMPLATE-ITEMS-FOR-PRINTING-TEMPLATES

Your HERMES PROFILE contains the settings of your current
filters, templates and destinations, your user-created filters
and templates, your collection of USER-FIELDS, and the settings
of your SWITCHES.

The PROFILE is stored in a TENEX file named ^-HERMES'-^.PROFILE;1
or in a TOPS-20 file named ^-HERMES'-^.PROFILE.1.  This file may
have any version number in place of "1".

When you enter HERMES, your Active-Environment is automatically
set to the ^-HERMES'-^.PROFILE file in your login directory.
When you CONNECT to another directory, HERMES pays no attention
to the ^-HERMES'-^.PROFILE file in the connected directory.  This
holds true whether you use the TENEX/TOPS-20 CONNECT command (at
the @ prompt) or the HERMES CONNECT command (at the > prompt).

If your UPDATE-PROFILE switch is set to YES, your Active
Environment is automatically copied into your PROFILE when you
QUIT, EXIT or LOGOUT.

It is possible to SET your Active-Environment to a file other
than the ^-HERMES'-^.PROFILE in your login directory.  Similarly,
you can EXPORT your Active-Environment to a different file.
   Current filters, templates and destinations, switch settings
   user-fields, and user-created templates and filters
   that are in available to you during a Hermes session.
   Initially set to YES, this switch causes your PROFILE to be
   updated automatically when you QUIT or LOGOUT from HERMES.
   SET and EXPORT allow you to transfer profiles from one
   user another, and to switch your Active-Environment from 
   one profile to another.
   Second-level editor containing tools for changing the PROFILE
   independent of the Active-Environment.

Top-Level Command (> prompt):
EDIT PROFILE         Enters the PROFILE editor; edits the file
                      ^-HERMES'-^.PROFILE.

Subcommands (p-> prompt):
DONE                 Makes changes permanent.  Returns to >.
ABORT        from 
   one profile to another.

You can use Hermes to place your Active Environment in a
transferrable profile file.

>EXPORT Active-Environment NEWNAME          for HERMES filenames.
or
>EXPORT Active-Environment NEWNAME.PRFL;1   for TENEX filesnames.
or
>EXPORT Active-Environment NEWNAME.PRFL.1   for TOPS-20 filenames.

Once you have a file named NEWNAME.PRFL.1 (or NEWNAME.PRFL;1 on
TENEX), you may use it to set the Active Environment of some
other user.  Suppose SMITH has EXPORTED his Active Environment
into the file NEWNAME.PRFL.1 in his directory, and you want to
set your Active Environment to SMITH's NEWNAME.PRFL file.  You
give the commands:

@HERMES
>SET Active-Environment <SMITH>NEWNAME.PRFL.1  for TOPS-20 filenames.
or
>SET Active-Environment <SMITH>NEWNAME         for HERMES filenames.

Now, you have the same Active Environment as the NEWNAME.PRFL
file.  If you quit HERMES (and if your UPDATE-PROFILE switch is
set to YES), your profile will be updated to your Active
Environment.  However, HERMES will warn you that your Active
Environment is not from your original profile, and require you to
confirm the update.

However, if you want to switch back to your original profile
before quitting, you need only give the command:

>SET Active-Environment <ESC>

This command always defaults to the ^-HERMES'-^.PROFILE file in
your login directory.

The commands COMPOSE, REPLY and FORWARD, available at both
top command level and in the DRAFT-EDITOR, provide a series
of prompts that allow you to fill in fields of the draft
message.

These prompts are controlled by TEMPLATES, which may contain
the names of FIELDS for you to fill in, along with "literal"
fields that are already filled in, and "quoted strings",
containing explanations for the user.

The REDISTRIBUTE and COMMENT commands available at top
command level act upon messages in your message-file and
prompt you for fields to be added the these messages.  These
commands are not controlled by templates.

The COMMENT command in the DRAFT-EDITOR prompts you for a
comment on a specified field in the draft.
   Prompts you to compose a new draft message.
   Prompts you to create a reply to a message.
   Places messages inside the text of a new draft message.
Asks you for addressees, distributes copies of messages in your
message-file to them (and not to addressees in To, Cc and Bcc.
   At top level, adds a [Text] field with a notation of user and
   date to a message in your message-file.  In the DRAFT-EDITOR
   adds a TEXT-type comment on a specified field.

Hermes has distinctive prompts for top-level commands and the
commands in the different object editors.

@     Prompt for the TENEX or TOPS-20 operating system.
>     Top-level commands (when you first enter Hermes).
>>    The DRAFT-EDITOR, where draft messages are edited before
       being sent.  Enter with COMPOSE, CREATE, EDIT, REPLY,
       FORWARD, EXPLODE <msg-no.>, EDIT MESSAGE <msg-no.>.
+>    Prompt for switch overrides.  Type ",<CR>" instead of
       "<CR>" to end a command.  When you see +>, type ? to see
       the switch, overrides that may be used to modify the
       action of the command.
d->   The DRAFT-FILES-EDITOR.  Enter with EDIT DRAFT-FILES.
       Exists only if the FILENAME-INPUT switch is set to HERMES.
f->   The FILTER-EDITOR.  Enter with CREATE FILTER <name> or
       EDIT <name>.
m->   The MESSAGE-FILES-EDITOR.  Enter with EDIT MESSAGE-FILES.
       Exists only if your FILENAME-INPUT switch is set to HERMES.
ms->  The MAILSTAT editor.  Enter with the MAILSTAT command.  
        Used for handling undeliverable mail.
p->   The PROFILE-EDITOR.  Enter with EDIT PROFILE.  Editors
        within the PROFILE-EDITOR (for filters, switches,
        templates and user-fields) have the prompts pf->, px->,
        pt-  and pu->.
r->   The RECORD-OF-MESSAGE-FILES-EDITOR.  Enter with EDIT
       RECORD-OF-MESSAGE-FILES.
s->   The SEQUENCE-EDITOR.  Enter with CREATE SEQUENCE <name> or

       EDIT <name>.
u->   The USER-FIELDS-EDITOR.  Enter with EDIT USER-FIELDS.
x->   The SWITCHES-EDITOR.  Enter with EDIT SWITCHES.

Default template for the PRINT command.  When you first enter
Hermes, your PTEMPLATE is set to a copy of the contents of
PRINT-FORM.  Thereafter, you may EDIT the contents of the
PTEMPLATE, and you may ERASE its contents, but you cannot
substitute another name as the default for PRINT.

To see the contents of your PTEMPLATE, type

>SHOW PTEMPLATE<CR>

Some characters used as punctuation in ordinary text have special
control functions in the HERMES system.  These are:
     ? . , : ; !
   
   At any point in a command, ? shows you a list of the words
   you are allowed to type.
   Symbol for the current message.
   Separator in message-specificiations.
   For message-nos. or line-nos., 5:10 means 5 through 10.
   In message-specifications, prevents the preceeding spec
   from being modified by anything that follows the ";".
  Allows escape from Hermes filenames.

Syntax:   > PUSH <CR>

PUSH allows you to use the TENEX or TOPS-20 Operating program
in a "lower fork" below the HERMES System.

The TENEX/TOPS-20 prompt is "@".  To return to the HERMES
System, type "QUIT" to the TENEX prompt or "POP" to either
the TENEX or TOPS-20 prompt.

     >PUSH<CR>
     @QUIT<CR> or POP<CR>
     >

The PUSH command allows you use the full range of commands in
the Operating System without QUITting the HERMES System.

WARNING: The HERMES System retains the CMESSAGE-FILE it had
when you gave the PUSH command.  If you intend to work upon
that message-file by calling another message-handling system
(such as MSG or HG), or an editing system (such as Teco), DO
NOT use the HERMES PUSH command.  Instead, you should QUIT
the HERMES System and enter the other system through a
top-level command.  The HERMES System has interlocks to
protect a message-file from a second HERMES System -- your
own or someone else's -- but there are no interlocks to
protect a message-file against other systems.

You may use the lower-fork operating system to connect to a
second directory.  The HERMES System retains the
CMESSAGE-FILE it had when you gave the PUSH command; however,
in any subsequent commands, the HERMES System defaults to the
directories specified by the GET-DIRECTORY and FROM-DIRECTORY
switches.

(EXAMPLE exists.)
   Synonym for PUSH.
One-letter synonym for Quit
(Not available on TOPS-20)

Syntax:   >QFD <file-list><CR>
Defaults: >QFD   <USER>*.*;*

     QFD prints on your terminal all TENEX directory information
about <file list>, where <file list> is one or more TENEX file
designations, separated by commas.

The default prints all TENEX directory information about all the
files in your directory.

This command prints the equivalent of the TENEX command Directory
with subcommands EVERYTHING, CRAM, and NO (HEADING).

The ? facility breaks up long lists of possible choices, showing
you the most important ones first.  Step through the complete
list with repeated ?'s.

In the text of a message-field, ? is an ordinary character.
Do NOT use ? in a TENEX file-name; it will abort the type-in.

(EXAMPLE exists.)
   >? gives a list of basic top-level commands. Type another ?
        for more top-level commands.

   >SU? gives a list of commands that begin with SU.

   >SURVEY ? gives a list of objects that can be used at the
        <messages> position in a SURVEY command.  These include
        sequences, filters and names of fields, as well as
        "Msg #", which means any range of message numbers.

Syntax:  >QUIT<CR>

     QUIT stops the HERMES Message System and returns the user to
the Operating System.  If you have deleted messages, QUIT asks
permission to EXPUNGE and renumber the message-file.  You may
continue the HERMES program after QUIT, by typing CONTINUE to
the TENEX/TOPS-20 prompt @.

QUIT and EXIT are identical, but have independent switches.
QUIT has subcommands that override the QUIT-EXPUNGE-SWITCH.
Type ,<CR> instead of <CR>.

(EXAMPLE exists.)
>QUIT<CR>
Message file <MYER>MESSAGE
  Messages 13:19,23 deleted;
  Expunge and renumber? Y<CR>
Stopping HERMES.
@
   One-letter synonym for QUIT.

When you GET, QUIT or EXIT, should deleted messages in the old
message-file be Expunged?

      GET-EXPUNGE       [X]Ask           Yes          No
      QUIT-EXPUNGE      [X]Ask           Yes          No
      EXIT-EXPUNGE      [X]Ask           yes          No
To override these switches, type ",<CR>" instead of "<CR>" to
end the GET, QUIT or EXIT command.  Type ? to +> prompt to 
see the override commands.  End override mode by typing <CR> 
to +> prompt.

You may use any text string that does not include <CR> and
that is enclosed in quotes as a single template item.

     "<quoted string>"

In PRINTING TEMPLATES, the text enclosed in quotes is
included in the output of the PRINT, SURVEY, LIST, FORWARD or
INCLUDE command that uses the template.

In COMPOSING TEMPLATES, the text enclosed in quotes is
printed on the user's terminal during the operation of the
COMPOSE, REPLY or FORWARD command.  It is not included in the
draft message.

Quoted strings may be used to give instructions to the user,
or to prompt for a field by some label other than the field
name.  To do this, include the quoted string before the field
name, and omit the + following the field.

(EXAMPLE exists.)
PRINTING TEMPLATES:

When you enter HERMES, the system prints an INITIAL-SURVEY of all
RECENT messages.

-+   1  536 15-Jul-77 MOOERS at BBN-TENEXA HERMES HELP INFORMATIO

HERMES also notifies you with a SURVEY when a new message arrives.
This message is generally the next message in your file, unless
you have been skipping around in your file.

To print the next message, type

     ><LF>               The LINEFEED key (NOT followed by <CR>)
                         prints the next message, AND
                         sets it to be the CURRENT message.

     >^                  The UP-ARROW or CARET key (NOT followed
                         by <CR>) prints the previous message
                         AND sets the CURRENT message.

     >PRINT<CR>          prints the CURRENT message.

For a quick survey of all messages in your current message-file

     >SURVEY<CR>

To survey specific messages

     >SURVEY 4,2,5:7<CR>   surveys messages 4,2,5,6,7.

     >PRINT 4,2,5:7<CR>    prints the messages in the sequence
                           AND sets the CURRENT message to 7.

     >SURVEY 10:5          surveys messages 5:10 in reverse.
     >PRINT PREVIOUSSEQUENCE prints messages 10:5.
     ><LF>                 prints message 6.

The fields Mail-From: and Received-Date: are appended to messages
when they are deilvered either by Hermes (for direct delivery) or
by the most recent version of the TENEX or TOPS-20 delivery
programs.

Older versions of TENEX and TOPS-20 delivery programs append the
line

     Mail from <host> rcvd on <date> <time>

The change was made for the purpose of conforming to RFC733
standards for ARPAnet messages.  RFC733 requires that header
fields consist of a name, followed by a colon, followed by the
contents of the field, i.e.,
	
Mail-From: BBNA
Received-Date: 19-Feb-80 1234-EST
  Template item that prints the date the message was received.

The RECORD-OF-MESSAGE-FILES contains a record of the date
and time that you last accessed any message-file with HERMES.
This is used to determine which messages are RECENT to you.

The record is stored in a file named {-MAILSYSTEMS'-}.PROFILE;1
on TENEX and {-MAILSYSTEMS'-}.PROFILE.1 on TOPS-20.  The version
number must always be "1".

Top-Level Command (> prompt):

system form of the file name, regardless of the setting of your
FILENAME-INPUT Switch.

Syntax:   >REDISTRIBUTE <message-no> <CR>
Defaults:                 CMESSAGE

HERMES allows you to redistribute a message without wrapping it
up in a jacket (like FORWARD), or changing the Sender:, Date:,
and Message-ID fields (like EXPLODE).

REDISTRIBUTE prompts you for addressees, and places them in the
Redistributed-To: field.  REDISTRIBUTE then asks you whether to
REFILE the message.  The message is then transmitted.  In all,
three new fields are added:

     Redistributed-To: <addressee-list>
     Redistributed-By: <connected directory> <login directory>
     Redistributed-Date: <date>

(EXAMPLE exists.)
JONES at OFFICE-1 redistributes a message to MOOERS at
BBN-TENEXA:
Redistributed-To: MOOERS at BBN-TENEXA
Redistributed-By: JONES
Redistributed-Date: February 1, 1977

MOOERS at BBNA, connected to AIRPLANES, redistributes a
message to RUBINSTEIN at BBND:
Redistributed-To: RUBINSTEIN at BBN-TENEXD
Redistributed-By: AIRPLANES MOOERS
Redistributed-Date: January 17, 1977

The message will also have acquired an additional "Mail from ..."
line which will help identify the host from which it was
redistributed.

When you REDISTRIBUTE a message, should a copy of the message
with the Redistributed-By, Redistributed-To and Redistributed-Date
fields be refiled over the original message in your message-file?

  REDISTRIBUTE-REFILE [X]Ask        Yes          No

Field added by the REDISTRIBUTE command.

Field added by the REDISTRIBUTE command.

Field added by the REDISTRIBUTE command.
	
Syntax:      >>Reference: <characters> <CR>
		
Reference: is a LINE-TYPE field.  It accepts any characters,
and is terminated with a <CR>.

To continue to a another line, type a comma before the <CR>.

                           END
Syntax:   >>REFILE       <message-no.>    <CR>
Defaults:          <msg previously exploded>

REFILE places the contents of the CDRAFT (in the message editor)
in the <message-no.> slot in the current message-file.  You are
shown a survey of the message previously in the <message-no.>
slot, and asked for your OK before it is deleted.

To place the refiled message at the end of the message-file, as a
new message:

     >>REFILE END<CR>

NOTE: If you have refiled a large number of messages, you may get
the following error message when you attempt to refile:

     ? No room in parseq segment to refile message

The remedy is to  go to top command level, EXPUNGE your message-file,
return to the draft-editor, and give the refile again.  You
will have to remember your message-no.

(EXAMPLE exists.)

When you REFILE a draft message in your current message-file,
how should Hermes require you to confirm?

    1. Survey: By printing a survey of the message you are
       about to destoy with the refile, and asking "OK?"

    2. Confirm: By asking "OK to refile?:"

    3. No: No confirmation required.

  REFILE-CONFIRM    [X]Survey       Confirm      No

Should the current draft message be ERASEd after a copy is
placed in the current message-file by the REFILE command?

  REFILE-ERASE         Ask       [X]Yes          No

Syntax:     f->REJECT <filter criterion><CR>
Defaults:                  none

     To reject messages that match the filtering criteria,
include "REJECT" followed by the criterion.

(EXAMPLE exists.)
The following would select all messages except those that are
SEEN or concerned with weather:

f->REJECT SEEN <CR>
f->REJECT SUBJECT: WEATHER<CR>
     A SEEN message would be rejected because of the first
     criterion; a message about weather would be rejected because
     of the second.

Use the MARK command to mark messages with the REMIND status:
 
>MARK <msgs> REMIND
 
This command causes all the messages in the <msgs> specification
to appear automatically in your initial survey, each time you
enter Hermes.
 
REMIND is also a message specification, which selects all the
messages that have REMIND status.

You can MARK messages NOREMIND, to remove REMIND status:

>MARK <msgs> NOREMIND   removes remind status from <msgs>.
>MARK REMIND NOREMIND   removes REMIND status from all messages.

The REMIND status is preserved when messages are filed in another
message file.

REMIND messages are marked with the status flag "*" in the
SURVEY-FORM template, and with "REMIND" in the PRINT-FORM template.
(The default templates for SURVEY and PRINT are initially set to
copies of these templates.)

   >UNGET
	
The UNGET command caused Hermes to let go of the MESSAGE-
FILE.  Later, after a new message arrives, the GET
command will cause Hermes to access the MAIL.TXT.1 file
again, and triggers an initial survey:

The status flags are controlled by the Status: template item,
in its two forms, Status: and Status:+.

Status:      Status:+              Meaning of the Status flag
======       ====================  ==============================

*            REMIND                Remind status only
   The Status: template item shows whether messages are UNSEEN,
   RECENT or have REMIND status.

Use the MARK command to mark messages with the REMIND status:
 
>MARK <msgs> REMIND
 
This command causes all the messages in the <msgs> specification
to appear automatically in your initial survey, each time you
enter Hermes.
 
REMIND is also a message specification, which selects all the
messages that have REMIND status.

You can MARK messages NOREMIND, to remove REMIND status:

>MARK <msgs> NOREMIND   removes remind status from <msgs>.
>MARK REMIND NOREMIND   removes REMIND status from all messages.

The REMIND status is preserved when messages are filed in another
message file.

REMIND messages are marked with the status flag "*" in the
SURVEY-FORM template, and with "REMIND" in the PRINT-FORM template.

You can REMOVE messages from a named sequence at top
command level.

Syntax:      >REMOVE <messages> <sequence> <CR>
Defaults:                ---     CSEQUENCE

Syntax:  >REPLY <message no.> <template><CR>
Default:          CMESSAGE     RTEMPLATE
Initial
Setting:            ---        REPLY-FORM

REPLY automatically sets up fields in the outgoing message
(typing them out as it does so) so that all that is required of
the user is to enter the Text:-field.  The user is given the
option of replying just to the author of the original message or
sending copies to its other recipients as well.

REPLYING TO MESSAGES FROM OTHER MESSAGE SYSTEMS

Hermes 4.1.12 will REPLY to some messages that contain a From:
field and no Sender: field.  Hermes will handle the following
types of From: field:

     1) From: Name at Host
     2) From: Some random string <Name at Host>
     3) From: Name at Host (Some random string)
     4) From: (Some string) Another string <Name at Host>

The " at " may be replaced by "@" or by " @ ". The Name must not
contain a space.  For example, Hermes will accept:

     5) From: Joe.Name at Host

Hermes will not handle:

     From: Joe Name at Host
     From: Name (Some random string) at Host

(EXAMPLE exists.)
Myer replies to Luca, using the RTEMPLATE set to its initial
setting of REPLY-FORM:

>REPLY<CR>
To: LUCA
Subject: Re: Typewriter Received
In-Reply-To: <[BBN-TENEXA]16-Jan-76 21:14:39-EST.LUCA>
(Type text of reply, to ^Z)
Text:
Glad to hear it.  It should be a help.
Ted <CTRL-Z>^Z
Send?: Yes<CR>

Myer now decides to make a new reply template that will
automatically add a Cc field to the draft.

>COPY REPLYFORM MY-RTEMPLATE<CR>
>EDIT MY-RTEMPLATE<CR>
>>LINE-INSERT 1<CR>
literal Cc: Myer<CR>
<CTRL-Z>
>>SHOW MY-RTEMPLATE<CR>
(1) literal [Cc: Myer]
(2) "(Type text of reply, to ^Z)"
(3) Text:
>SET RTEMPLATE MY-RTEMPLATE<CR>

If Myer preferred to place a "file carbon copy" in some other
file, he could insert a literal Fcc: field, in place of a
literal Cc: field, e.g.,

>EDIT MY-RTEMPLATE<CR>
>LINE-INSERT 1<CR>
literal Fcc: SAVED-MSGS<CR>
<CTRL-Z>
>>SHOW MY-RTEMPLATE<CR>
(1) literal Fcc: SAVED-MSGS.TXT;1
(2)  literal [Cc: Myer]
(2) "(Type test of reply, to ^Z)"
(3) Text:

>>ERASE 1<CR>

Address a reply to the To: and Cc: field, as well as to the
From: field (if it contains a valid address; otherwise to
the Sender:)?

    1. Ask: Asks if you want to send copies to the To:
       field.  If you answer Yes, then asks if you want
       to send copies to the Cc: field.  If you answer No,
       doesnot ask about the Cc: field.

    2. Yes: Sends copies to both the To: and Cc: fields.

    3. No: Sends the reply only to the From: field.

To override this switch, type ",<CR>" instead of "<CR>" to end
the REPLY command.  Type ? to +> prompt to see the override 
commands.  End override mode by typing <CR> to +> prompt.

  REPLY-DELETE      [X]Ask          Yes          No

New switch for people who want to delete messages as they read
them, but only AFTER the reply to each message has been sent.

   Ask: "Delete replied-to message after REPLY?"
        Type Y<cr> or <cr> for YES and N<cr> for NO.
   Yes: Delete the replied-to message automatically.
   No:  Leave the message undeleted.

Note: to avoid confusion, the name of the REPLY-ERASE switch
has been changed to ERASE-BEFORE-REPLY.  The names of the
COMPOSE-ERASE and FOWARD-ERASE switched have not been changed.
These switches control whether the current draft (CDRAFT) is
erased before the REPLY, COMPOSE or FORWARD command takes effect.

If your username appears in the To: or Cc: field of the
message to which you are replying, should HERMES include it
in the Cc: field of the reply?

NOTE: This switch has no effect if (a) the REPLY-COPIES
switch is set to NO, or (b) your username does not appear in
the To: or Cc: field of the original message.

  REPLY-INCLUDEME      Ask       [X]Yes          No

To override this switch, type ",<CR>" instead of "<CR>" to end
the REPLY command.  Type ? to +> prompt to see the override 
commands.  End override mode by typing <CR> to +> prompt.

After the COMPOSE, REPLY or FORWARD command has completed
prompting you for the set of fields, should the message
automatically be sent?

      COMPOSE-SEND      [X]Ask           Yes          No
      FORWARD-SEND      [X]Ask           Yes          N0
      REPLY-SEND        [X]Ask           Yes          No

	
Syntax:        >>REPLY-TO <addressee-list> <CR>
Default:                        none
		
Reply-To is an ADDRESSEE-TYPE field.  If an incoming message
contains a Reply-To: field, the Hermes REPLY command addresses
the reply message to the names in the Reply-To: field rather than
the name in the From: or Sender: field.

The PRINT-FORM template for Hermes 4.1.14 (and later versions)
prints the Reply-To: field.  If, however, you began to use
Hermes before Version 4.1.14, your PTEMPLATE (the default template
for the PRINT command) is a copy of the older PRINT-FORM template,
and does NOT print the Reply-To: field.

     NOTE: Reply-To: is a new fixed field, so it is not printed 
           by the User-fields: template item.

If you have never edited your PTEMPLATE, you should SET your
PTEMPLATE to be a copy of the new PRINT-FORM template:

>SET PTEMPLATE PRINT-FORM<CR>

If you have edited you PTEMPLATE, you will want to edit it again
to place the Reply-To: template item on a line by itself.

(Example exists.)

How should HERMES report NEW  messages?  (Those  that  arrive
during a session)?

    1. Survey: Prints a bulletin: "XX NEW MESSAGES HAVE JUST
       ARRIVED," plus a survey of each message.

    2. Bulletin: Prints the bulletin only.

    3. NoReport: Does not report NEW messages.

 REPORTFORM       [X]Survey        Bulletin     NoReport

If REPORTFORM is set to Survey or Bulletin, when should
reports be made?

    1. Periodic: After a fixed interval, NEW messages are
       reported at the next prompt, or periodically without a
       prompt, whichever comes first.

    2. AtPrompt: After a fixed interval, NEW messages are
       reported at the next prompt.

Hermes also also checks when you are likely to know that you
have new messages because (a) you put the messages in your
message-file, or (b) the TENEX or TOPS-20 has just told you
that you have new mail.  This occurs after the commands SEND,
REFILE, REDISTRIBUTE, FILE, MOVE, EXEC or PUSH (followed
POP), and RUN.

  REPORTNEWMESSAGE   [X]Periodic    AtPrompt

Syntax:     f->REQUIRE <filter-criterion><CR>
Defaults:                    none

     To select messages that match the filtering criteria,
include "REQUIRE" followed by the criterion.

(EXAMPLE exists.)
The following would select all SEEN messages concerning weather:
f->REQUIRE SEEN<CR>
f->REQUIRE SUBJECT: WEATHER<CR>
     An UNSEEN message would fail based on the first criterion;
     a SEEN  message  without "WEATHER" in the subject would fail
     based on the second.
Syntax:  >>RESTORE-DRAFT <draft-file><CR>

     RESTORE-DRAFT causes all message fields in the specified
draft-file to be appended to the corresponding fields in the
current draft (CDRAFT).  The draft-file may be created by:
     1. The STORE-DRAFT command.
     2. The Editor Interface backup file, WHOLEDRAFT.COPY.
     3. The Hermes file, $DRAFT-BACKUP...
     4. Any other backup file created by an auxiliary editor, 
        with either a "save" or "autosave" feature, e.g., the
        the ;S command in TECO and TV, and the EMACS "autosave"
        feature which creates $HERMES-EMACS-BACKUP.HRM.

If you attempt to use RESTORE-DRAFT with an ordinary file, such
as a file created by SAVE-FIELD, Hermes will ask you some
questions to determine which field to use to append the contents
of the file.


Hermes has two commands that place a stored message (more than
one field) in the draft.  The EXPLODE command (and its synonym
EDIT MESSAGE) place a copy of a message in the current
message-file in the draft.  The RESTORE-DRAFT command places a
copy of a message stored in a draft-file in the draft.

For either command, if non-empty fields are present in the draft,
should they be erased before the new draft is appended?
	
      EXPLODE-ERASE     [X]Ask          Yes
      RESTORE-ERASE     [X]Ask          Yes          No

Syntax:   s->REVERSE<CR>

REVERSE is a subcommand of the SEQUENCE-EDITOR
that reverses the order of messages in a sequence.

(EXAMPLE exists.)
Suppose you had a sequence containing messages 1, 9, 2, 3 and 11:

s->SHOW<CR>
1,9,2,3,11
s->REVERSE<CR>
s->SHOW<CR>
11,3,2,9,1

The RUBOUT key on some terminals, and the DELETE or DEL key on
others.

TENEX:   <RUBOUT>/<DEL> aborts a command before the final <CR>.
         In a command line, <RUBOUT> has the same effect as 
         <CTRL-Q>, echoes as XXX and a new line.  <RUBOUT> has no
         effect inside a message-field.

TOPS-20: <RUBOUT>/<DEL> deletes a single character.  In a
         message-field, does not delete back across unit parts
         of an addressee name in the To:, Cc:, Bcc: or other
         ADDRESSEE type fields, or a TENEX file designator in the
         Fcc:-field.  Echoes as the deleted character, plus \.

If you make a mistake in typing one or a few characters, you can
correct your work, one character at a time.
          HES<RUBOUT>S\RMES

In the print-out at your terminal, this appears as
          HESS\RMES

The string that goes to the computer is
          HERMES

Syntax:   >RUN <TENEX/TOPS-20 file name><CR>
Defaults:        none

WARNING: Set your FILENAME-INPUT-SWITCH to TENEX (or TOPS-20)
before you attempt to use this command.

     RUN allows you to load and run a TENEX (or TOPS-20) "Save
Core" File without leaving HERMES or using the Exec command to
start up a lower fork of the Operating System program.

The HERMES command RUN works like the Operating System command
RUN, with the following exceptions:

(1) The TENEX/TOPS-20 command RUN is the default command for the 
    Operating System.  The HERMES System has no default command.

(2) The TENEX/TOPS-20 Operating System has a set of priorities
    for looking in different directories in the system for any
    file-name that is typed without a directory name.  The HERMES
    System looks only in the User's CONNECTED directory.

(EXAMPLE exists.)
>RUN MYPROGRAM.SAV;3<CR>
where MYPROGRAM is a program in the User's directory.  HERMES
executes the program.  However, the command
     >RUN TECO.SAV<ESC>
fails because the TECO.SAV file is in the the TENEX <SUBSYS>
directory.  To execute the Teco program using the RUN command, it
is necessary to type in the directory name:
     >RUN <SUBSYS>TECO.SAV<ESC>
One-letter synonym for SURVEY.

Syntax:   >>SAVE-FIELD <field name> <destination> <CR>
Defaults:                 TEXT:         none

     SAVE-FIELD saves all or part of a draft message for use in
a later HERMES session or for other use outside HERMES.  It
copies the contents of the draft message into a destination,
which can be a draft-file, the LINE-PRINTER or even the TERMINAL.
SAVE-FIELD with a specific field-name copies the contents of that
field into the destination.

The draft-message in the DRAFT-EDITOR is not erased.

Draft-files may be inserted inside fields by using
APPEND-FILE or <CTRL-B>.  Alternatively, they may be processed
through other text-handling facilities in the Operating System.

SAVE-FIELD ALL has the same effect as STORE-DRAFT; it creates a
draft-file that can be restored with RESTORE-DRAFT.

(EXAMPLE exists.)
>>SAVE-FIELD TO: ADDRESSLIST<CR> [New File]<CR>
     This causes HERMES to save the contents of the TO: Field
     in the file ADDRESSLIST.
>>SAVE-FIELD Text REPORT<CR> [Old Version]<CR>
     This appends the contents of the text field to the contents
     of the existing draft-file REPORT.
>>SAVE-FIELD ALL JONESDRAFT<CR>
     This saves the entire draft message in a specially formatted
     draft-file.  Restore this draft message with RESTORE-DRAFT.
>>SAVE-FIELD ALL LINE-PRINTER<CR>
     This prints the entire draft message on the LINE-PRINTER
     (in its specially formatted form).
  Controls whether to erase the corresponding field(s) of the draft 
  for both SAVE-FIELD and STORE-DRAFT.

When (a) the contents a field is saved in a file with the
SAVE-FIELD command, or (b) the contents of a whole draft is
stored with STORE-DRAFT, should the corresponding field(s) in

When you QUIT or EXIT from HERMES, or when you GET a new
message-file, should HERMES preserve the parse of the
message-file you are leaving?

The SAVEPARSE switch allows you to discard the "parse" portions
of the "parseq" (up-arrow) files associated with your
message-files, without losing any named sequences you have
created.

The "parseq" (up-arrow) file is usually reduced to 3 pages
(possibly 1 or 2 pages more if there are voluminous sequences).

Since HERMES now automatically discards bad parses and since
the cost of regenerating the parse is high, in CPU charges and
in real time, most users will want to leave the SAVEPARSE
switch set to "Yes".

However, some users who have extremely limited disk space, or
who never save large message-files, or who seldom access the
same message-file more than once, have requested the "No"
setting.

If the SAVEPARSE switch is set to No, HERMES warns you when a
parse is discarded.

Syntax:     >>SEARCH  <field> <CR>
Default:               Text:

SEARCH prompts you with the word String: and allows you to type
in a string of characters, ending with <CR>.  Searches the field
for first occurance of the string. Shows numbered or unnumbered
according to SHOW-FIELD-SWITCH.

You can control the way the command works by setting the MATCH-
CASE switch, or by using subcommands.  Type ,<CR> instead of <CR>
after you type SEARCH and the field name (if it is different from
Text:).  You will get a +> prompt.  Type ? to the +> prompt to
see your choices:

    MatchCase    NoMatchCase    FirstMatch    AllMatches

AllMatches searches for all occurances of the string, not just
the first one.  Type in your choices, ending each choice with
<CR>.  Then begin the action of the SEARCH command by typing
<CR> to the +> prompt.
   Controls both SEARCH and EXCHANGE commands. Allows you match 
   or not match upper and lower case in the string.

Message specifications search the current sequence, CSEQUENCE.
When you enter Hermes the CSEQUENCE is set to * (= ALLMESSAGES).
Use the CONSIDER command to change the CSEQUENCE.

1) A field.  This selects every message that contains that field,
      regardless of contents.

2) Before, On or After <date>, selects by the Date: field.  

   NOTE ABOUT DATES: Explicit dates must have day, month and year, 
   in any reasonable form.  Weekdays specify dates in a three-week 
   window centered on this week. "Last Monday" is Monday of last
   week (even if today is Tuesday), and  "Monday" or "This Monday"
   is Monday of this week.  "Next Monday" is Monday of next week.

3) A DATE-type field, followed by Before, On or After, followed
      by a date, selects by the date in that field.

4) A non-Date field, followed by a "substring", that is, a partial 
   specification of the contents.  If the substring contains a 
   space, use quotes.

   NOTE ABOUT SUBSTRING SEARCHES: You can bind the search to the
   beginning or end of the field by using the | character.  If
   you want to search for the | character itself, use TWO |"s,
   e.g., || (that is, quote the character with itself).  

   a) A LINE-type field, or a TEXT-type field -- but NOT the Text:
      field.

   b) An addressee field (To:, Cc:, Bcc: or a user-created field)

   NOTE ABOUT ADDRESSEE FIELDS: Hermes rejects unknown hosts, and
   local names that it cannot recognise. Hermes will not search
   within parentheses in addressee fields.
   Sender: is an addressee field, but From: is not.

5) A FILTER. This is a set of criteria that is stored a Hermes
   object, under an object name.
 
1) A field:
           >SURVEY Bcc<cr>    selects messages with Bcc's.
           >PRINT [Text]<cr>  prints messages with [Text]
                              fields (which may have been
                              created by COMMENT).
2) Before, On or After followed by a date:
           >SURVEY On December 1 1981<cr>
           >LIST After 1 Jul 81<cr>
           >CONSIDER Before Last Friday<cr>
           >SURVEY Before Yesterday<cr>
3) A Date-type field followed by Before, On or After and a date.
           >PRINT Rcvd-Date Before 10/6/81<cr>
           >SURVEY Suspense-Date: On: 9 DEC 81<cr>
           >LIST End-Date: After: 12/14/81<cr>
           >FORWARD Special-(Date): Today<cr>
4)  A non-Date field followed by a substring
      a) Line- or Text-type fields (but not Text:)
           >PRINT From: Jones<cr>
           >SURVEY Keywords: Weather<cr>
           >LIST Subject: "Stormy weather"<cr>
           >SURVEY [Text]: Approved<cr>
 
      b) Addressee-type fields
           >SURVEY To: Jones<cr>
           >PRINT To: Smi<cr>  Selects both "Smith" and "Smiley".
           >SURVEY To om       Selects OMALLEY@BBNA,
Momerath@ISI,
                               and @DARCOM-KA)
     Cc: Jones at ISIA,  Bcc: at SRI-CSL, To @BBNG

      c) The | character binds the substring to the beginning
         or end of the field
           >SURVEY Subject: 502|<cr>
           >SURVEY [Text]: |"Note by SMITH"
           >PRINT To: |J<cr>      
5) A filter.
           >UNDELETE DELETED<cr>    DELETED is a fixed filter.
           >SURVEY RECENT<cr>       RECENT is a fixed filter.
           >FILE SMITH<cr>          SMITH is a user-created filter.
   Basic types of selection.

Synonym for SEND; avoids conflict between SEND and SENDER
in the DRAFT-EDITOR.
	
Syntax:     SEND <CR>
		
SEND causes the message to be delivered to the addressees in the
To:, Cc:, and Bcc: fields, and to be filed in the files in the
Fcc: field.  If the message is delivered locally, you are
notified immediately; otherwise the draft message is submitted to
the delivery service on the local host computer.  Once sent, the
message is erased from the draft-editor, and you are returned to
the top level.

the delivery servie picks up the message from a queue, but you
can force immediate transmission by using the MAILER command.
   Controls whether messages are delivered locally, queued or
   forced through MAILER immediately.
   A queued message, waiting to be picked up by the delivery
   service is stored as a file named [UNSENT-MAIL].NAME@HOST.

Should the current draft be erased after the draft message is
SENT?

  SEND-ERASE           Ask       [X]Yes          No

To override this switch, type ",<CR>" instead of "<CR>" to end
the SEND command.  Type ? to +> prompt to see the override 
commands.  End override mode by typing <CR> to +> prompt.

When a message is SENT, how should the transmission of the copies
of the message be reported to the sender?

    1.  All.  Copies are reported as (a) Delivered, for Local
        Append, or Queued.  If the TRANSMIT-METHOD switch is set 
        to MAILER, the output of the MAILER command is shown.

    2.  Transmitted.  Copies actually transmitted (via
        Local Append or MAILER are reported.  Queued copies are 
        not reported.  If all copies are queued, Hermes prints OK
        to show that message is sent.

    3.  None.  Hermes prints OK to show that message is sent.

  SEND-REPORT          All          Transmitted    None

For users with old profiles, the initial setting of SEND-REPORT
is Transmitted but, for technical reasons, the [X] does not show
up until the switch has been SET once.

To override this switch, type ",<CR>" instead of "<CR>" to end
the SEND command.  Type ? to +> prompt to see the override 
commands.  End override mode by typing <CR> to +> prompt.
MOOERS at BBNA sends (1) a message to HOTLINE at BBND, with a
Cc to Mooers, and (2) another message to HOTLINE at BBND with
no Cc.  Since HOTLINE is on another host computer, the copies
that are sent to HOTLINE must be queued for delivery by
MAILER.  The Cc message to MOOERS can be delivered directly
by Hermes.  (Mooers' TRANSMIT-METHOD switch is set to
LocalAppend.)

  SEND-REPORT          All          Transmitted     None

(1) report	Mooers delivered.	Mooers delivered.	OK
		HOTLINE at BBND queued

(2) report	HOTLINE at BBND queued	OK			OK

When you SEND a message, Hermes automatically fills in the
Sender: field with your login directory.

Hermes also fills in the From: field with your connected
directory, unless you have supplied a From: field.

If you change your mind about sending, after HERMES  prints
CONFIRM, you can abort with <CTRL-E>.

When you SEND a message, HERMES creates copies for each of
the addressees, and tells you which ones can be delivered
immediately.  The copies to JONES and  ROBINSON have been
queued for another program, named MAILER, which picks them
up a few minutes later and delivers them.  HERMES does not
tell you which messages are queued.
   The Text: field for a draft may be encrypted with ENCODE.
   Decode with any printing command, e.g., PRINT, or with the
   DECODE command in the DRAFT-EDITOR.
   COMPOSE, REPLY, FORWARD, REDISTRIBUTE and COMMENT commands
   help you compose by giving you prompts.
   Second-level commands let you fill in, edit and format fields,
   and save and re-use fields and entire drafts.

    The template item Separate causes a page break (by
inserting <CTRL-L> into the output).  Separate is generally
included at the end of a message, but page break will occur
whenever Separate appears.

Top-Level Commands (> prompt):
CREATE SEQUENCE name Creates a new sequence.
EDIT name            Edits an existing sequence.

Subcommands (s-> prompt):
DONE                 Makes changes permanent.  Returns to >.
ABORT                Aborts changes.  Returns to >.
ADD             msg  Adds specified messages to current sequence.
ERASE           msg  Removes specified messages from sequence.
INTERSECT-WITH  msg  Performs a logical intersection between
                      specified messages and current sequence.
REVERSE         msg  Sorts current sequence into reverse order.
SHOW                 Shows message-nos. in current sequence.
SORT          field  Sorts current sequence by field or attribute.
SURVEY               Prints surveys of all messages in sequence.
Basic Commands (> prompt):
CREATE SEQUENCE  seq  Creates a new empty sequence.
                       Enters the SEQUENCE editor (s-> prompt).
                       Return to top level with DONE.
ADD  msg seq msg-no   Adds messages to a sequence; inserts
                       them  before the specified message-no.
ERASE     seq         Erases a user-created sequence.  Erases 
                       contents of a current sequence.
REMOVE    msg seq     Removes messages from a sequence.
SORT      seq field   Sorts a sequence according to a field.
WHEREIS   msg         Shows which sequences contain messages.

Advanced Command (> prompt):
CONSIDER  msg         Changes the contents of CSEQUENCE.

A "sequence" is a HERMES object, consisting of a list of
message-nos.  with a name.  When your DELETED messages are
EXPUNGED, and the rest renumbered, the stored sequences are
automatically updated.  Sequences are stored in the parseq file
corresponding to the message-file.

          Ex.: >PRINT PREV<ESC>IOUSSEQUENCE<CR>

Current:          EDIT contents, or set with SET or CONSIDER.
 CSEQUENCE        Default sequence used the SURVEY command.
                   Initially set to ALLMESSAGES.

User:             CREATE your own User Sequences.

Fixed:            Fixed sequences cannot be EDITed or SET.
 ALLMESSAGES(=*)  All the messages in current message-file.
 REVERSE          ALLMESSAGES in reverse order.
 PREVIOUSSEQUENCE Messages most recently used in a command.
                   Also, enter PREVIOUSSEQUENCE as a complete
                   message specification by typing <CTRL-P>.
 EMPTY-SEQUENCE   Sometimes used with the SET command.

Creating and Editing Sequences:
>CREATE SEQUENCE name   Creates a new sequence.

1) Top-level editing:  Leave the SEQUENCE editor with DONE.
   Use commands SHOW, ADD, SORT and REMOVE.

Advanced Commands:
2) Second-level editing:  Type subcommands to s->.
Create a permanent sequence of all messages from Jones and all
messages from Smith which were to Jones:

     >CREATE SEQUENCE JONESMITH<CR>

This causes HERMES to enter the sequence editor and name the
new sequence JONESMITH.

     s->ADD FROM: JONES<CR>
     s->ADD FROM: SMITH/TO: JONES<CR>
     s->SHOW<CR>
      1,10,5,2,3,12
     s->DONE<CR>
     >
JONESMITH can now be entered freely wherever messages are
expected.

     >LIST JONESMITH<CR>
     >PRINT JONESMITH/AFTER 21-DEC-75/BEFORE 1-JAN-76<CR>
     >SURVEY 1, JONESMITH,4:7,RECENT/UNSEEN<CR>

Suppose you have another sequence named WEATHER:

     >SHOW JONESMITH<CR>
      1,10,5,2,3,12
     >SHOW WEATHER<CR>
      1,5,6,11
Note that messages 1 and 5 appear in both sequences.   In
each  case the  message  file contains only one copy of the
message; each sequence contains a reference to that single copy.

     >DELETE 5<CR>
     >EXPUNGE<CR>
     >SHOW JONESMITH<CR>
      1,9,2,3,11
     >SHOW WEATHER<CR>
      1,5,10
After Delete and Expunge, JONESMITH and WEATHER were
adjusted automatically  to account for the changed file
contents.  The reference to message 5  disappeared  from
JONESMITH  because that  message was expunged.  References
to messages 6, 9, 10, 11 and 12 became references to
messages 5, 8, 9,  10  and  11 when the file was renumbered.

At top command level:
Syntax:   >SET  <current-object> <specification of contents><CR>
Defaults:           none         CSEQUENCE, CFILTER, PTEMPLATE,
                                 <USER>MESSAGE or CMESSAGE

     SET is the command used to set the contents of a current
object, which may be CSEQUENCE, CFILTER, a current template, a
current destination, the CMESSAGE-FILE, or the current message
(CMESSAGE or ".").  SET does not require confirmation.

In the SWITCHES-EDITOR:
Syntax:  x->SET    <switch> <setting> <CR>
Defaults:            none      none

SET is a subcommand in the SWITCHES-EDITOR that changes the
setting of one switch at a time.

(EXAMPLE exists.)
At top command level:
>SET CSEQUENCE 15:65/From Smith<CR>
>SET FDESTINATION OLDMSGS<CR>
>SET LDESTINATION TERMINAL<CR>

In the SWITCHES-EDITOR:
x->SHOW CR-FUNCTION<CR>
  CR-FUNCTION       [X]Recognize    Extend
x->SET CR-FUNCTION Extend<CR>
x->SHOW CR-FUNCTION<CR>
  CR-FUNCTION          Recognize [X]Extend
   Has the same function as SET CSEQUENCE.
   Has the same function as SET CMESSAGE-FILE.
   Has the same function as SET CMESSAGE.

At top command level:
Syntax: >SHOW <object or object type> <destination> <CR>
        >SHOW All <Objects, Sequences, Filters, Templates><CR>
        >SHOW Current <Sequences, Filters or Templates>...
        >SHOW Fixed <Sequences, Filters, Templates>...

        >SHOW NAMES <any of the above>...
        >SHOW TYPED-FORM <To:, Cc: or Bcc:>...

SHOW prints on your terminal the name and contents of an object,
a group of objects of an object-type, or all objects.  You can
ask for "user", "current" or "fixed" objects separately.  SHOW
NAMES prints the names only.  If SHOW produces too much output,
stop the printout with <CTRL-O> and then send the output to a
different destination -- the LINE-PRINTER or a draft-file.

In the DRAFT-EDITOR:
Syntax: >>SHOW <line-nos>   <field>      <numbered/unnum> <CR>
               or <field>
Default:      entire draft  Text, if     Defaults to SHOW-FILE-
                           user types    DEFAULT switch but
                            line-nos.    unnumbered if all of
                                         draft is shown.

If the user types a range of line-nos., e.g., 5:21, the field 
defaultsto the Text: field.

SHOW prints on your terminal the name and contents of a range
of lines, a single field, the group of header fields, or the
entire draft message.

It is not possible to SHOW to a LINE-PRINTER destination in the
DRAFT-EDITOR, but you can place part of all of a draft in a
file with the SAVE-FIELD, STORE-DRAFT or REFILE commands.

All of the object editors (such as the SEQUENCE-EDITOR or the
DRAFT-FILES-EDITOR) contain SHOW subcommands.

(EXAMPLE exists.)
At top command level:
>SHOW CSEQUENCE<CR>
1:55
(.=37)
>SHOW CMESSAGE-FILE<CR>
55 messages in file <USER>MESSAGE ; 10 unseen ; 5 deleted
>SHOW ALL<CR>

Keywords: Messages, HERMES
Subject: Use of the HERMES System to send message.
>>SHOW 1<CR>

>>SHOW 1:2<CR>
 1      This is the first line of the Text.
 2      And here is another line.


When you use the EXCHANGE command, should the system show
you each exchange?

Note: The No setting (or a No answer to Ask) overrides the
CONFIRM-EXCHANGES switch; there is no point in confirming an
exchange if you do not see it.  The entire line that contains
the exchanged string is shown, numbered or unnumbered
according to the setting of the SHOW-FIELD switch.

  SHOW-EXCHANGES       Ask       [X]Yes          No

To override this switch, type ",<CR>" instead of "<CR>" to
end the EXCHANGE command.  Type ? to +> prompt to see the
override commands.  End override mode by typing <CR> to +>
prompt.

When you SHOW a single field in the DRAFT-EDITOR, should the
lines be numbered or unnumbered?

      SHOW-FIELD      Numbered  [X]Unnumbered

This switch also governs the way lines are shown in the
CHANGE and EXCHANGE commands.

To override this switch, type either Numbered or Unnumbered
after the field name.  (N or U is enough for HERMES to recognise.)

(Example exists.)
>>SHOW Text Numbered<CR>
1     Now is the
2     time for ...

>>SHOW 2 Text Unnumbered<CR>
time for ...

>>SHOW To Numbered<CR>
1     Mooers at BBNE, RRude

>>SHOW<CR>        still defaults to showing the entire draft
                  always unnumbered.
At top command level:

    LENGTH                Sort numerically by Char-Count
    MESSAGE-NO            Sort in order of message number
    MESSAGE-ID            Sort alphabetically by message-ID

(EXAMPLE exists.)
Because sequences get built up and manipulated in various ways,
they can be in rather ragged order:

s->SHOW<CR>
1,9,2,3,11

They can be restored to the "normal" order of the message file
by:

s->SORT<CR>
s->SHOW<CR>
1:3,9,11

However, it might be more meaningful to sort by author:

s->SORT FROM<CR>
s->SURVEY<CR>

The template item "Source:" prints the From: field unless
the message is from the User.  If it is, Source: prints
"To:" followed by the first name in the To:-field.

     "Source:+" prints both labels, "From:" and "To:".
     "Source:" prints only "To:".
   When this switch is set to CONNECTED directory, Source: 
   prints the To: field if either the Sender: or From: field 
   contains the connected directory.  When the switch is set
   to LOGIN, Source: operates on the login directory.

Space-bar character.  Separates arguments in commands.  May be
used interchangeably with <ESC> except that the <SPACE> cannot be
used to default a command argument.

Set your SPACE-FUNCTION Switch to "Extend" to make <SPACE>
print command and argument names in full.  Set to "NoiseWords"
to make <SPACE> act like <ESC>.

(EXAMPLE exists.)
At the beginning of an argument, <SPACE> acts as a filler.
If you type in an argument, <SPACE> acts a separator between
arguments:
     >Print RECENT NEW-TEMPLATE<CR>

When an argument contains a list of items, <SPACE> acts as a
filler after the comma or other separator character between the
items.
     >Print RECENT, 3,  5, 6

But if you type a <SPACE> after an item, the system closes the
sequence argument and expects you to type the template argument.

    1. Recognise: As in older versions of the HERMES system,
       SPACE and <CR> cause recognition of HERMES commands and
       names but do not print anything.

    2. Extend: SPACE and <CR> automatically extend (i.e., print
       in full) HERMES commands and names.

    3. NoiseWords: SPACE acts like <ESC>, extending, printing
       "noise words", and entering default arguments.

  SPACE-FUNCTION    [X]Recognize    Extend     Noise-Words
  CR-FUNCTION       [X]Recognize    Extend
	
Syntax:      >>Special-Handling: <characters> <CR>
		
Special-Handling: is a LINE-TYPE field.  It accepts any
characters, and is terminated with a <CR>.

To continue to a another line, type a comma before the <CR>.

	
Syntax:      >>SPELL <CR>              (Text: field only.)
		
SPELL runs a spelling correction program on the Text field of
the message.  SPELL is an independent BBN program which runs
in a lower fork, like Teco, Xed, Neted and We.  There is an
on-line Help feature within SPELL, and it is documented in
the TENEX USERS' GUIDE (Jan 76 edition, page 173.)

A new version of SPELL is in preparation which will allow you
to save and use your own incremental dictionary.

     STANDARD is the name of a fixed template which contains
all the automatic and fixed fields, plus the template item
"User-Fields:", which prints all User-fields present in the
message, and the template item "Other:" which prints any lines of
the incoming message that are not automatic, fixed or User fields.

The template item "Standard:" inserts all the fields of the
STANDARD template into a template.
	
Syntax:      >>Start-Date: <date> <CR>
		
Start-Date: is a fixed field, of the DATE type.

A date field may contain only a single date.  A <CR>
terminates the field.  The date is stored in its typed-in
format.

You may enter the date as Today, Yesterday, or almost any
reasonable form of the date, such as 13 OCT 1978, 13-OCT-78,
October 13, 1978, or 10/13/78.


Your DIRECTORY is a work and storage space on the computer,
identified by your user-name.

Storage in a directory consists of files, identified by
file-names.  You may handle files either through Hermes or
through the operating system.  Use the FILENAME-INPUT switch 
to choose either HERMES or TENEX (or TOPS-20) file-names.

Basic Commands (@ prompt):
LOGIN  directory password account
                   Gives you access to the top fork of TENEX or
                    TOPS-20, or to HERMES (for direct login).
                    "Directory" is your user-name.  The password
                    does not print.  You may default the account
                    by typing an <ESC>, a space or a <CR>.
HERMES             Gives you access to the HERMES program at
                    top command level (> prompt).
LOGOUT             Gets you off the computer.

Basic Commands (> prompt):
QUIT               Leaves HERMES; returns you to the top-fork
                    TENEX/TOPS-20; can update PROFILE.
LOGOUT             Hermes QUIT plus TENEX/TOPS-20 LOGOUT.

Advanced Commands (> prompt):
EXIT               Duplicate of QUIT.
SUSPEND            Pops you up to top-fork TENEX/TOPS-20
                    without releasing the message-file or
                    updating the PROFILE.  You can return to 
                    HERMES by typing CONTINUE to the @ prompt.
CONNECT directory password  (may also be typed at @ prompt)
                   Gives you access to the files (but not the
                    HERMES profile) of another directory.

Advanced Commands (>> and other second-level commands):
ABORT              Destroys changes made in a second-level
                    editor and returns to >.
DONE               Makes changes final in a second-level editor
                    and returns to >.

Advanced Commands (> or >> prompt):
PUSH               Puts you in a lower fork of TENEX/TOPS-20
                    below HERMES.
EXEC(=PUSH)

Advanced Command (@ prompt):
POP                Gets you back into HERMES (at > or >> prompt)
                    from a lower fork of TENEX/TOPS-20.

  Arrange for direct login with the computer center.
  HERMES supplies system notices and disk allocation warnings.

When the HERMES System starts up, should it get your Inbox, (the
message-file  MESSAGE)?  Note that you can send messages
when you are not connected to a message-file.

  STARTWITHINBOX       Ask        [X]Yes          No


Switch Override: Use different procedures on TENEX and on TOPS-20:

1) To start HERMES with a message-file other than your Inbox:

   TENEX:    @HERMES ANYFILE<CR>

             NOTE: Type a space after HERMES.

   TOPS-20:  @HERMES,<CR>
              (using message-file) ANYFILE<CR>

2) To start HERMES with no message-file:

   TENEX:    @HERMES <CR>
              (using message-file)<CR>

   TOPS-20:  @HERMES,<CR>
              (using message-file)<CR>

NOTE: Unlike other switch overrides, the override mode for
the HERMES command does not print a +> prompt; however, it
does print the noise words "(using message-file)" under some
conditions.
	
Syntax:    >STATUS <CR>
		
The STATUS command provides you with a brief report on your
message file and the status of each message in the file.

In a printing template, the "Status" item prints information
only when messages are RECENT or UNSEEN.  "Status+" prints
"UNSEEN RECENT".  "Status" prints "-+".

Messages are marked UNSEEN until you examine them with a
template that prints the Text field.

Messages are marked RECENT if they have arrived since you
last QUIT HERMES.  The RECENT designation is determined by
the date you last QUIT HERMES.  HERMES compares that date,
which is stored in your RECORD-OF-MESSAGE-FILES, with the
Rcvd-Date of the message.

Messages are usually marked DELETED with the DELETE command.
The UNDELETE command removes the DELETED marking.  (The
EXPUNGE command permanently removes all messages marked
DELETED from your message-file, and renumbers the file.)

You can use the MARK command to mark messages with the status
designations: SEEN, UNSEEN, DELETED, UNDELETED.

(EXAMPLE exists.)
>STATUS<CR>
9 Messages in file <MYER>MESSAGE.TXT,1; 3 unseen; 0 deleted
Syntax:      >>STORE-DRAFT <destination><CR>
Defaults:                       none

     STORE-DRAFT is used to save an entire draft message.  All
fields are output to the destination, which may be a draft-file,
the LINE-PRINTER or even the TERMINAL.  The draft-message in the
DRAFT-EDITOR is not erased.  STORE-DRAFT gives the user a way
of saving a multi-field message that is not ready to be sent.

Files created by STORE-DRAFT can be restored in the same or a
later session by using RESTORE-DRAFT.

In Hermes 4.3.1, and higher versions, files created with
STORE-DRAFT have the same format as the $DRAFT-BACKUP... files
and any files created under the Editor-Interface style, such as
WHOLEDRAFT.COPY and $HERMES-EMACS-BACKUP.HRM.  They may be edited
with any text editor, but they should not be added to a field in
the draft with APPEND-FILE or <CTRL-B>.

(EXAMPLE exists.)
>>STORE-DRAFT JONESDRAFT<CR>
     This saves the entire draft message in a draft-file.
     Restore this draft message with RESTORE-DRAFT.
>>STORE-DRAFT LINE-PRINTER<CR>
     This prints the entire draft message on the LINE-PRINTER.
  Saves the contents of a single field in an unstructured file.
  Controls whether to erase the corresponding field(s) of the draft 
  for both SAVE-FIELD and STORE-DRAFT.
	
Syntax:      >>Subject: <characters> <CR>
		
Subject: is a LINE-TYPE field.  It accepts any characters,
and is terminated with a <CR>.

To continue to a another line, type a comma before the <CR>.

Hermes automatically fills in the Subject: field in the REPLY
and FORWARD commands.


To send a suggestion or complaint to the HERMES staff, use
the COMPOSE command with the fixed template SUGGESTION:

     >COMPOSE SUGGESTION<CR>

 The SUGGESTION template has the form

     SUGGESTION
     (1) literal [To: MYER@BBNA
        To: MOOERS@BBNA]
     (2) literal [Cc: AIRPLANES@BBNA]
     (3) literal [Keywords: Suggestion on BBN HERMES 4.1.1]
     (4) Subject:+
     (5) Text:+

Hermes prompts you to type a command by printing a "prompt
character".  The prompt is > at top command level and >> in the
DRAFT editor.  The TENEX or TOPS-20 prompt is @.

Important commands at top command level:

SURVEY    prints a summary of all messages
PRINT     prints the current message.
<LF>      prints the NEXT message.
DELETE    deletes the current message.
UNDELETE  removes deleted markings.
COMPOSE   prompts you to compose a draft.  Leaves you in the 
          DRAFT-EDITOR if you don't answer Yes to Send?
REPLY     prompts you to compose a draft reply to a message.
FORWARD   prompts you to compose a draft forwarding a message.
FILE      files a message in a different message-file.
GET       lets Hermes read a different message-file.
QUIT      leaves Hermes; returns to TENEX or TOPS-20..
LOGOUT    logs out directly from Hermes.

Important commands in the DRAFT-EDITOR:
FORMAT    evens up lines in a message.
ERASE     erases lines or an entire field.
<field>	lets you enter contents in the field.
INSERT    inserts contents before a specified line in a field.
CHANGE    lets you edit a single line.
EXCHANGE  exchanges "old" for "new" strings in a field.
SEND      sends a draft.
DONE      returns to top command level without sending.
ABORT     destroys the draft and returns to top command level.

Also in the DRAFT-EDITOR: COMPOSE, REPLY, FORWARD, SURVEY, PRINT.

In this documentation, characters that cannot be printed, such as
Carriage-Return, Line-Feed, the Escape key and the "control
characters", are represented by letters enclosed in angle
brackets, e.g., <CR>, <LF>, <ESC> and <CTRL-E>.  To type a
control character, hold down the key marked CTRL and type the
letter key simultaneously.

You must type a <CR> after all commands except <LF> , ^ and the
"control characters".

Sometimes you may type additional words before the <CR>, to
modify the action of the command.  Separate these words by typing
either a space or <ESC>.
The defaults for the PRINT command print the current message
in the form specified by the PTEMPLATE on your terminal (symbol
TTY:).

If the current message is no. 10, and you type "PR", followed by
a series of <ESC>'s you will see

>PRINT (messages) 10 (using template) PTEMPLATE (on file) TTY:

If you type:
     >?

HERMES print a list of all top-level commands.

If you type

     >SU?

HERMES prints a list of all top-level commands that begin
with SU, then waits for you to type the rest of the word:

     
     SURVEY
     SUSPEND
     >SU

Use ? and <ESC> freely.

     ?          tells what choices you have.
     <ESC>      tells what defaults the system has set up.
   Switches that cause HERMES to print command words in full,
   to specify terminal type, and to use either HERMES or
   operating system (TENEX/TOPS-20) filenames.
   Special characters that save you when you type the wrong thing.
   Used to correct typing mistakes.
   Used to edit fields of the draft message.
   How to use the OUTLINE, DESCRIBE, EXAMPLE and DOCUMENT
   commands to get more information.
   Escape key causes Hermes to print out completely any word
   you have typed, then print words in parentheses to introduce
   the next part of the command.  Typing <ESC> again inserts the
   "default".  Most commands have defaults useful to the beginner.
   At any point, even within a word, typing ? causes Hermes
   to print a "menu" of all possible choices on your terminal.

Use <ESC> and ? freely.  They help you find your way around Hermes.
 
   Use the command COMPOSE SUGGESTION to send a message to
   the Hermes design team.
  Allows "escape" from HERMES filenames.

Settings:             ALL    SURVEY-FORM  TERMINAL

SURVEY is designed to display brief surveys of messages in

SURVEY displays them; otherwise it shows only the message-nos.
of the deleted messages.  With the standard STEMPLATE, the +
sign means RECENT, - means UNSEEN and * means that the message
is marked REMIND.

In the SEQUENCE-EDITOR:
Syntax:   s->SURVEY <CR>

SURVEY prints a survey (using the STEMPLATE) of each message
currently in the sequence being edited.

(EXAMPLE exists.)

Syntax:    >SUSPEND<CR>

     SUSPEND has the same effect as typing the interrupt
character <CTRL-C> at top command level.  Hermes halts, and you
can go back to the same state that you left, by typing the TENEX
command "Continue" to the TENEX/TOPS-20 prompt "@".  HERMES
resumes with the CMESSAGE-FILE, the CMESSAGE, all objects and all
outgoing message fields intact.

(EXAMPLE exists.)
>SUSPEND<CR>
  Suspending HERMES
@CONTINUE<CR>
  Resuming HERMES
>

If you want to call HERMES again, without continuing, give the
TENEX/TOPS-20 command "RESET".

@RESET<CR>

NOTE: The TENEX/TOPS-20 command "REENTER" has the same effect as
"CONTINUE" after SUSPEND, QUIT and EXIT, BUT "REENTER" MAY NOT
be used after <CTRL-C>.
	
Syntax:      >>Suspense-Date: <date> <CR>
		
Suspense-Date: is a fixed field, of the DATE type.

A date field may contain only a single date.  A <CR>
terminates the field.  The date is stored in its typed-in
format.

You may enter the date as Today, Yesterday, or almost any
reasonable form of the date, such as 13 OCT 1978, 13-OCT-78,
October 13, 1978, or 10/13/78.


You can override some HERMES switches at the time that you
type in the corresponding commands.  To invoke the overrride
mode for most switches, type ",<CR>" instead of "<CR>" at the
end of the command.  You will get the override prompt +>.  To
see the override commands, type ? to the +> prompt.  End each
override command with <CR>, then end the override mode by
typing <CR>, alone, to the +> prompt.

There are two exceptions:

   1) The HERMES command, typed to the @ prompt, allows you to 
      override the STARWITHINBOX switch, or to start with a
      message-file other than your Inbox.  the override
      differs for TENEX and TOPS-20.

   2) The SHOW, CHANGE and EXCHANGE commands allow you to override
      the SHOW-FIELD switch by typing "Numbered" or "Unnumbered"
      just before you end the command with <CR>.

(EXAMPLE exists.)

SWITCHES govern the way many commands and other features of
HERMES work.  You can show either ALL switches, or any one
switch.

     >SHOW SWITCHES<cr>
     >SHOW SWITCH <switch-name><cr>

Switches are listed in six groups, but it is not possible to
(yet) to SHOW a group of switches.  However, you can DESCRIBE
each group.  See the related topics below.
   Different styles of handling your Inbox and other
   message-files.
   Choices about when messages are deleted and files expunged.
   Choices about the INTERFACE-STYLE (EDITOR for screen
   terminals or COMMAND-LINE), also about auxiliary editors,
   formatting, erasing drafts and REPLY copies.
   Turns off questions, specifies transmission method.
   Specifies primary directory for files and for From: field.
   SET switches to print command words in full, to specify
   terminal type and to use either HERMES or TENEX/TOPS-20
   filenames.
   Switches for operation of SHOW, CHANGE and EXCHANGE
   commands, and for auxiliary text editors, Teco, Xed and WE.
   The UPDATE-PROFILE switch lets you automatically save
   changes to switches, templates, and user-fields, etc.,
   when you QUIT.  You can turn off the checks for new mail
   and for text left in the DRAFT-EDITOR.  
   You can override some switches at the time that you type
   the corresponding HERMES commands.
   Lets you SET switches to other values.

Top-Level Commands (> prompt):
EDIT SWITCHES        Places you in the SWITCHES editor.

Subcommands (x-> prompt):
DONE                 Makes changes permanent.  Returns to >.
ABORT                Aborts changes.  Returns to >.
SHOW  switch         Shows switch and setting.  (Default: All)
SET   switch set     Changes switch setting.

  How to override a switch for one command only.

Miscellaneous options when you compose messages.
  Also governs EDIT MESSAGE (synonym of EXPLODE).

When should messages be deleted?  When should the message-file be
expunged?

Choices for the operation of the Hermes editing commands,
SHOW, CHANGE and EXCHANGE, and for the use of the auxiliary
text editors available for use in a lower fork below Hermes.

   The I (=Insertion) subcommand of CHANGE can notify the user
   with a bell, with !, or not at all.
   The SHOW command in the DRAFT-EDITOR can default to showing
   single fields with lines either numbered or unnumbered.
   Also governs CHANGE and EXCHANGE.
   The EXCHANGE command can ask or not ask you to confirm each
   time it replaces the old string with the new string.
   The EXCHANGE command can match or not match the case of the
   letters in the old string.
   The EXCHANGE command can show or not show each exchange on
   your terminal.  If NO, you are not asked to confirm.
   The EDIT command in the draft editor can call the TECO, XED or
   WE text editors.
   When you enter the Text: field, or any TEXT-type field, you
   may be placed directly in your default editor.

The "Lifestyle" switches allow you to make certain choices
about the way Hermes commands are typed and files are
handled.
   The SPACE character can cause recognition, or "extend" to the
  full name, or print "noisewords" like <ESC>.
   The carriage-return character <CR> can cause either recognition
   or extension.
   Allows use of capabilities of some advanced terminals for 
   the WE editor.  Also allows true backspace on TIs and
   screen terminals.
   Choose either HERMES or operating system (TENEX/TOPS-20)
   file handling.
   Lets you turn off the requirement to type <CR> twice to
   confirm commands.
   For Hermes command and object names, allows automatic
   spelling correction, no correction or correction with
   confirmation required.
   Sets terminal type for lower- and upper-case or for upper-
   case only.
   Lets you choose your editing characters for character-
   delete and line-delete to be those of the local host
   computer, of TENEX or of TOPS-20.

You may GET files from either the LOGIN or the CONNECTED
directory without typing the directory name in angle
brackets.  You may place the name of either directory in your
FROM field.

These switches allow you different styles of handling your INBOX,
and other message-files.

What should happen automatically when message-composition is
completed?

The automatic UPDATE-PROFILE-SWITCH can be turned off, and
you can cause Hermes to stop asking you whether you really
want to QUIT if you have new mail, or if you have anything
left in the DRAFT-EDITOR.

Users who log in directly to Hermes can be protected against
accidentally typing QUIT.

The SYNTAX line in a DESCRIBE topic specifies the form of the
HERMES command.  The conventions used are:

     1) All HERMES commands and argument names are presented in
        upper-case letters.

     2) Argument types in lower-case letters within
        angle brackets.

     3) Terminators are shown in capital letters in brackets.

(EXAMPLE exists.)
Syntax:   PRINT <messages>  <template>  <destination> <CR>

     This denotes that PRINT is a HERMES command, that it can
     take three arguments: sequence, template and destination,
     and that it requires a carriage-return as a terminator.

The TAB key enters the same character as <CTRL-I>.
1

Syntax:   >TALK <text><CTRL-Z>
Defaults:        none

     TALK allows you to type in a string of characters that has
no effect on HERMES.  You can terminate the <text> only by typing
<CTRL-Z>.

The most common reason for using Talk is to "talk" to someone who
has linked to you through the TENEX Exec command "Link".

Syntax:   >>TECO  <field-name> <CR>
Defaults:              Text:

     TECO is a standard Tenex editor, available as a subcommand
of the HERMES draft-editor.

NOTE: If you get into TECO by mistake, <CTRL-C> will get you
back to the HERMES >> without loss.

     TECO creates an "inferior fork" of TENEX TECO, that is, a
copy of TECO inside HERMES, with the specified field of the
message in the TECO buffer.  You may then use all of the
available TECO commands to edit the field.  (Note that the
terminator character in TECO is <ESC> rather than <CR>.)

Return to HERMES by typing
     ;H<ESC>

HERMES prints: "Replace the Text field?" or whatever field has
been edited.

If you respond by typing <CR> or Y<CR>, HERMES inserts the
edited version of the buffer as the new message field.

If you type N<CR>, the edited version of the buffer disappears,
and HERMES does not change the contents of the message field.

In either case, you are returned to the DRAFT-EDITOR.

As with XED, NETED and SPELL, we assume you know how to use TECO
before you invoke this command.  (See the TENEX USERS' GUIDE
(Jan 75 edition), page 189, or TENEX TECO: Text Editor and
Corrector Manual.)

(EXAMPLE exists.)
>>TECO<CR>
235 CHARS

The standard table of delimiter pairs for Hermes templates:
	
    [       ]
    <       >
    {       }
    "       "
    '       '
    `       '
    !       !
    |       |
    \       /
    #       #
	
These delimiter pairs can be used to enclose text in templates:

    a)  In "quoted string" template items.  Versions of Hermes
        before 4.1.18 allowed only the " ...  " pair.  The new
        set of delimiters has been chosen to be compatible with
        the Scribe formatting program.

    b)  In literal template items when the template is output
        to a text file through the use of the SHOW command, or
        in text files prepared in a text editor for input to a
        template through the use of FILE-INSERT command.

When you create a template in the TEMPLATE-EDITOR, using the
LINE-INSERT and ITEM-INSERT commands, you must type the contents
of a literal template item without delimiters.  Hermes then
encloses the contents in delimiters of its own devising --
beginning with the [ ...  ] pair.  When you create a text file
for input with the FILE-INSERT command, you are creating an
imitation of the stored form on the Hermes template, not the
template as it was typed in.  It is therefore good practice to
delimit contents of literal template items explicitly.

When you output a template to a file with the SHOW command, the
output routine must be able to distinguish between delimiters on
the one hand, and characters that happen to be on the list of
delimiters but are actually part of the text in the literal
template item, on the other.

The outputter routine tries very hard to do sensible delimiting
of the literals.  Working from the standard table of delimiter
pairs, the outputter scans the text to find the first pair for
which the end delimiter does not occur anywhere in the text, and
uses that pair to enclose the literal contents.  If there is no
such pair, the outputter will enclose the contents by "**" before
and after, but the inputter will not be able to parse it.
	
(Example exists.)
Suppose you can have created a file, named TEMP.HRM, that
contains the following series of lines

       >Any random string of text
       [More stuff to be ignored

      (10) literal [Subject: delimiter test]
      (9) literal <Subject: test ]>
      (8) literal {Subject: test ]>}
      (7) literal "Subject: test ]>}"
      (6) literal 'Subject: test ]>}"'
      (5) literal !Subject: test ]>}"'!
      (4) literal |Subject: test ]>}"'!|
      (3) literal \Subject: test ]>}"'!|/
      (2) literal #Subject: test ]>}"'!|/#
      (1) literal Subject: test ]>}"'!|/#
	
You can place the contents of the file in a template named
LITTST, using the FILE-INSERT command, and then show the template
to a file
	
      >Create template LITTST
      t->File-Input (before line)
      Input from file: TEMP
      Continue input from 

      >Show (object) littst (on file) LT10 [New file]

The contents of the file LT10.HRM will be

      >show (object) littst (on file) lt10 [New file]

      (1) literal [Subject: delimiter test]
      (2) literal <Subject: test ]>
      (3) literal {Subject: test ]>}
      (4) literal "Subject: test ]>}"
      (5) literal 'Subject: test ]>}"'
      (6) literal !Subject: test ]>}"'!
      (7) literal |Subject: test ]>}"'!|
      (8) literal \Subject: test ]>}"'!|/
      (9) literal #Subject: test ]>}"'!|/#
      (10) literal **Subject: test]>}"'!|/#**

If you then attempt to input the file into a new template
the template editor will omit the final line, which is
delimited by **.

Create your own templates.  These may contain User Fields mixed
with standard fields and other template items.

Top-Level Commands, > prompt:
CREATE TEMPLATE name Creates a new template.
EDIT name            Edits an existing template.
SHOW name            Places contents of an existing template
                     in a file for editing in a text editor.

Subcommands, t-> prompt:
DONE                 Makes changes permanent.  Returns to >.
ABORT                Aborts changes.  Returns to >.
ERASE     item line  Erases lines or items within a line.
ITEM-INSERT line item-no. items
                     Inserts new items within a template line.
LINE-INSERT line     Inserts new lines before line-no.
FILE-INSERT file line-no.
                     Inserts contents of a file before line-no.
SHOW        lines    Shows lines of current template.

Any field name may be used as a template item.  Other special
groups of template items are:

  a) Literal fields.  These are specified by typing the word 
     LITERAL followed by the field name, followed by the contents
     of the field, and ending with either <CR> or <CTRL-Z>.

     Ex.: literal Cc: Mooers, Myer<CR>

  b) Quoted strings.  Any string of characters enclosed in
     quotes.  The string must not include <CR> or <CTRL-Z>.
     In printing templates, items print as they appear on the
     template line.  Fields are separated by one space; quoted
     strings are not separated from fields or each other
     (so they can include punctuation).  A null quoted
     string, "", between two fields inserts no space,
     i.e., a null space, between the fields.

  c) Special template items effective in printing templates only:
  
       Source:                   Verbatim:
       Always-Dashed-Text:       User-Fields:
       Never-Dashed-Text:        Other:
       Standard:                 Separate:
   SHOW and FILE-INSERT allow you to edit templates in an
   ordinary text editor.

The items that can be specified in a composing template
include all Fixed fields which can be filled in by the user,
and all User Fields and Comment Fields, plus the following:
	
"<quoted string>"   Characters inside the quotes are printed on 
                     the user's terminal but are NOT included in
                     the draft message.
literal <field>     The field is included in the draft message AS
                     IF the user had typed it in.
		
Some items useful in output have no meaning for input, and
are ignored during a compose sequence.  These include the
Automatic fields and the special printing template items:
	
     Source
     Standard:
     Verbatim:
     Userfields:
     Other:
     Separate:
   Causes the name of the template to be printed as a prompt.
   Fields created automatically when the message is sent or
   received.

The items that can be specified in a printing template are
the Text: field and all header fields, including Automatic
Fields, Fixed Fields and User Fields, plus the following
special items:
	
Source              Prints From: field unless the message is
                     from the user.  If so, prints To: and first
                     name in To: field.
Always-Dashed-Text: Prints Text: field followed by ------.
Never-Dashed-Text:  Prints Text:.  Never prints ---------.
Standard:           Prints message with fields in standard order.
Verbatim:           Prints message exactly as received.
User-Fields:        Prints all user-fields that do not occur in
                     other parts of the template.
Other:              Prints the "Mail from ..." line and any other
                     part of the message not printed through
                     other template items.
"<quoted string>"   The characters in the string are included in
                     the printed output.  One line only.
Literal <field>     The field is included in the output as if it
                     had occurred in thhe original message.  The
                     effect is similar to quoted strings, but more
                     useful for large chunks of text.  The field
                     name is printed, except for Text fields.
Separate            Causes a page break (by inserting <CTRL-L> in
                     output).  Usually placed at end of template.

   Date:, Sender:, From:, Message-ID:, Status, Message-No.,
   Char-Count, Rcvd-Date, and Filed-Date.
   From:, To:, Cc:, Subject:, Bcc:, In-Reply-To:, Reference:,
   Keywords:, Precedence:, Message-Class:, Special-Handling:,
   Text:, Fcc:, Start-Date:, End-Date:, Suspense-Date:, and
   Class-Char.
   Any User-Field may be used as a template item.
   Following an item, causes it to be labelled with its name
   or to appear in an expanded form.
   Multi-item template lines produce just one line of output.
   Exceptions are lines with quoted strings and one other item.
"Templates" are HERMES objects stored in your PROFILE which are
used to specify the form of messages or drafts:

  1) For messages in message-files, "printing templates" control
     the form in which messages are printed, including:
       a) fields in the messages being printed.
       b) already filled-in (literal) fields in the template.
       c) other text in "quoted strings".

     Literal fields and quoted strings are indistinguishable from
     the contents of the messages being printed.

  2) For drafts, "composing templates" present the user with a
     series of prompts for fields.  Literal fields are included
     in the message as if they were typed by the user.  Quoted
     strings may be used for explanatory material for the user;
     they are printed on the user's terminal but not included in
     the draft.

The HERMES user needs to know some commands of the TENEX or
TOPS-20 operating system in order to enter and leave the
HERMES system and to delete and otherwise handle
TENEX/TOPS-20 files through the operating system, if the
FILENAME-INPUT-SWITCH is set to TENEX or to TOPS-20.

When you request output to your terminal, specify TERMINAL if
your FILENAME-INPUT-SWITCH is set to "Hermes", or TTY: if the
setting is "Tenex".

(EXAMPLE exists.)
If you want to print out messages according to the LIST command
on your terminal, type
     >LIST 20:37 <ESC>LTEMPLATE TERMINAL<CR>

If you set LDESTINATION to TERMINAL, both LIST and DOCUMENT will
default to print on your TERMINAL.
     >Get LDESTINATION TERMINAL<CR>

When you enter HERMES, should your terminal type be set so
that you type in both lower- and upper-case letters, or in
upper-case only?

  TERMINAL-CASE     [X]Lower/Upper    UpperCaseOnly

Lets you set your terminal type.

   1. WE(not-HP), HP2645 and HP2640 allow you to use the WE
      Editor.

   2. These settings, plus Screen(no-WE), are for screen terminals.
      They  cause <CTRL-A> (on TENEX), RUBOUT/DELETE (on 
      TOPS-20) and <CTRL-W> to make corrections by backspacing
      and erasing.

   3. The Print(bkspace) setting is for printing terminals with
      mechanical backspace; it causes the correction characters
      to backspace without erasing.

   4. The No-Backspace setting causes the correction characters to print
      \ followed by the character deleted (or the first letter
      of the word deleted for <CTRL-W>).

  TERMINAL-TYPE        WE(not-HP)    HP2645       HP2640

Syntax:       >>Text:  <characters> <CTRL-Z>
		
Text: is the only fixed TEXT-type field.  It accepts any
characters, and it terminates with <CTRL-Z>, which is echoed
as ^Z.  This allows you to use the carriage-return, <CR>,
normally in text.

In a printing template, the Text: template item prints the
Text: field exactly as received.  In a composing template, it
prompts the user to enter a Text: field in the draft message.

Versions of Hermes before 4.1.3, and some other message
systems, automatically place a line of seven dashes at the
end of the Text: field when the message is composed.

This is not true of the current version of Hermes.  At the
request of many users, especially those who use Hermes for
database management and other specialized applications, Herme
has been changed so that the line of dashes is no longer
added to the message being composed, under any circumstances.

For those of you who care whether or not the line of dashes
is printed at the end of the Text: field, we have created two
new template items:
	
     Always-Dashed-Text
     Never-Dashed-Text
		
These differ from the Text: item in Printing templates, but
in composing templates they are exactly like the Text: item.
They prompt for the Text: field but they do not add the line
of dashes at the end of the field.
   Prints Text: field;  prints one line of seven dashes
   (hyphens) at the end of the Text: field, whether or not
   such a line occurs in the original message.
   Prints Text: field; never prints the line of seven dashes.
   Gives you a choice (Ask-Yes-No) about whether HERMES should
   automatically FORMAT the TEXT field when you type <CTRL-Z>.
   IF YOU USE THE ARPANET PROGRAM, TELNET: Change your escape
   character from <CTRL-Z> to something else before you use
   HERMES; otherwise, <CTRL-Z> at the end of the Text: field
   returns you to TELNET.

When you complete the Text:-field, should the System
automatically execute a FORMAT command?

  TEXT-FORMAT       [X]Ask           Yes          No

Syntax:   <name>-(TEXT)  <multiline text>  <CTRl-Z>
          [<name>]

This is a multi-line text field, like the Text:-field.  It
may contain any text and must be terminated with <CTRL-Z>.
User-Fields of the TEXT type may be searched with filters.

All fields created with the COMMENT command are TEXT-type
fields.
   #####
>>Poem-(text)(to ^Z)
POEM-(TEXT):  Roses are first,
              Violets come next.
              You can search -(TEXT) fields,
              But you can't search Text:
              <CTRL-Z>^Z
Format?: N<CR>

>>COMMENT POEM-(TEXT)<CR>
[POEM-(TEXT)]: Note by MOOERS on 1 FEB 1977 1624
               No comment.<CTRL-Z>^Z
Format? N<CR>

Syntax: > TIME<CR>

Time prints the date and time on your terminal.

Syntax:      >>To: <addressee-list> <CR>

To: is an ADDRESSEE-TYPE field.  When you SEND the draft
message, a copy is transmitted to each name in the To:
field.  The To: field appears on all copies of the message.

If there is a GROUPNAME in the To: field, the Groupname only,
and not the list of addressees that follow it, is transmitted
when you SEND the message.


Topics are used to access on-line documentation.  They are
used as arguments for the documentation commands: DESCRIBE,
OUTLINE, EXAMPLE and DOCUMENT.  In general, all commands and
many nouns or hyphenated phrases presented in the
documentation are also topics.  You can obtain further
information about them by using the documentation commands.

(EXAMPLE exists.)
A few of the available topics are:  INTRODUCING-HERMES,
SELECTING-MESSAGES, DOCUMENTATION, LINE-PRINTER, and PROFILE.

Hermes handles the full range of TOPS-20 structure names and
logical devices, but handles the logical search list for DSK:
differently from the TOPS-20 system.

Aside from this difference, which may or may not be important to
you, when your FILENAME-INPUT switch is set to Hermes you can use
structure names, such as PS1:, as part of your directory and
filenames.  You can also use logical devices, created with the
TOPS-20 DEFINE command, for both directory and filenames.

(Example exists.)

NOTE ON THE SEARCH PATH:

The difference stems from the fact that when your FILENAME-INPUT
switch is set to HERMES, you have the convenience of being able
to type ?, at any point in a file specification.

If your logical search path has been set by the command:

@DEFINE DSK: DSK:, PS1:<SOMETHING>

the TOPS-20 system looks first in the connected directory, which
is DSK:, and then in the PS1:<SOMETHING> directory.

However, the TOPS-20 file-handing facilities attempt to find the
file only after the file specification is complete, i.e., after
you type <CR>.  In contrast, Hermes attempts to build a list of
possible file specifications as soon as you enter the file
specification part of a command.  Since Hermes recognizes only
message-files (with extension TXT), draft-files (with the
extention HRM), and profile-files (with the extension PRFL),
Hermes builds a list of files with the apprpriate extension in
the first directory in the search list that contains any files
with that extension.

If, for example, you have a file named
PS1:<SOMETHING>SPECIAL.TXT, and you type

>GET SPECIAL<CR>

when you are connected to your login directory, Hermes will fail
to find the file because it will look in your login directory
(where you have the MAIL.TXT file).

If your FILE-INPUT switch is set to TOPS-20, the command

>GET SPECIAL.TXT<CR>

will find the file (as long as there is no file named SPECIAL.TXT
in your connected directory).
If the file named LOGIN.CMD in the directory <MOOERS> has the
following contents:

DEFINE HS: PS:<SUBSYS>HERMES.EXE
DEFINE H1: PS1:<HERMES>
DEFINE C: PS1:<MOOERS>81-08-MAIL.TXT
DEFINE MEM: PS1:<HERMES>MEMOS.TXT

then the following commands may be used:

@LOG MOOERS <password><CR>
 Job 12 on TTY444 4-Aug-81 14:04:22
 End of LOGIN.CMD.10
                        The commands in the LOGIN.CMD file are
                        automatically executed.
@HS:<CR>
HERMES 4.1.18  .....
Getting <MOOERS>MAIL

                        The FDESTINATION is the default destination

                        MOVE-DELETE switch is set to YES, so that
                        the question "Delete messages after filing?"
                        never appears on the terminal.)

When you SEND a message, how should the copies of the
message be delivered?

     1. Ask:  HERMES first asks Queue all?  If NO,
        then Run MAILER? If NO, then LocalAppend only.

     2. Mailer: HERMES appends local messages to the addressees
        INBOXES if directory protection permits, then calls the
        MAILER program to deliver the other messages.

     3. LocalAppend:  HERMES appends local messages to the
        addressees INBOXES if directory protection permits, then 
        queues other messages for pickup and delivery by the
        MAILER program on its rounds, every 6 minutes or so.

     4. Queue:  All messages are queued for pickup and
        delivery by the MAILER program.

We expect that this provision will be temporary; MAILER ought 
to be rewritten to improve its performance for both local and
remote sending so that local sending through Hermes will not 
be necessary.

  TRANSMIT-METHOD      Ask        Mailer  [X]Local-Append
                                  Queue

To override this switch, type ",<CR>" instead of "<CR>" to end
the SEND command.  Type ? to +> prompt to see the override 
commands.  End override mode by typing <CR> to +> prompt.

Use the command

>COMPOSE SUGGESTION

to send a message to the Hermes staff.

On BBN computers only, send reports of problems with terminals to
SUTTON@BBNA.

If you have trouble GETting a message-file:

   a)  Check to see whether you have another job that is using
       the file.  Use the WHERE command on TENEX and the SYSTAT
       <user> command on TOPS-20.

   b)  If not, go to the @ prompt, RESET, then run one of the
       the following programs:
	
       <AIRPLANES>KILLPARSE on BBN computers
       <MAILSYS>KILLPARSE on SRI computers
       <HERMES>KILLPARSE on other computers
	
       This will destroy the "parse" portion of your PARSEQ
       file.  The PARSEQ file for MESSAGE.TXT;1 is
       ^MESSAGE.TXT^;1.  When KILLPARSE asks you for the name
       of the PARSEQ file, type in ^MESSAGE.TXT^;1.

   c)  There is a rare bug in the TENEX Exec which causes
       PARSEQ files to get a "bad index block".  You can
       diagnose this condition when KILLPARSE fails.  Try to
       COPY the parseq file using the TENEX COPY command.  IF
       the file had a bad index block, you will get an error
       notice about it.  In this case, the only thing to do is
       to DELETE and EXPUNGE the PARSEQ file, then RESET, enter
       HERMES again, and let HERMES rebuild the PARSEQ file.
       Deleting the PARSEQ file causes you to lose your stored
       sequences.  You can recover them, or most of them, by
       requesting the system operators to restore the PARSEQ
       file from the previous "memory dump".

   d)  On BBNA or BBND, you may have trouble with an archived
       PARSEQ or PROFILE file.  Use the command INFO ARCHIVE at
       the @ prompt to determine whether a file has archive
       status.

If you have trouble with a notice that says "File busy.  Try
again?"  repeatedly.

   a)  You may have a detached job that is holding the file
       open.  Check with the WHERE or SYSTAT command at the @
       prompt.

   b)  You may have encountered a bug caused by repeated use of
       the REFILE command, or the REDISTRIBUTE or COMMENT
       command at the > prompt.  QUIT HERMES, then RESET or
       LOGOUT.  When you use HERMES again, the problem should
       be fixed.
HOW TO RESTORE A DRAFT MESSAGE LOST IN A HERMES OR SYSTEM CRASH

HERMES 4.1.12 has automatic backup for messages being composed in
the DRAFT editor.  Every two minutes, HERMES creates or updates
two TENEX/TOPS-20 files.

$DRAFT-BACKUP-mon-day-time.HRM.1 contains a copy of the fields
created in the DRAFT editor.  You can RESTORE the draft message
from this file.

$TEXT-BACKUP-mon-day-time.HRM.1 contains a copy of the contents
of the Text: field (or any other TEXT-type field) that you are
currently creating.  You can use APPEND-FILE to place this file
in the TEXT: field.

  1) If you end HERMES normally, with the QUIT, EXIT or LOGOUT
     command, these files are automatically deleted.

  2) If you do not end normally, these files remain in your
     directory.  They are HERMES draft-files.

Suppose the computer or Hermes crashes while you are in the
middle of typing in the Text: field.

  1) Start up a new HERMES, by logging in again if necessary.

  2) Give the command
         >RESTORE $D<ESC><CR>

  3) Give the SHOW command to the >> prompt.  If your Text: field
     is not complete, give the command
          >APPEND-FILE $T<ESC><CR>

The backup files should contain all of the messages you were
creating, with the possible exception of text input during the
last two minutes preceding the crash.

When you request output to your terminal, specify TERMINAL if
your FILENAME-INPUT-SWITCH is set to "Hermes", or TTY: if the
setting is "Tenex".

(EXAMPLE exists.)
If you do not have access to a line-printer, but you want to
print out messages according to the LIST command on your
terminal, type
     >LIST 20:37 <ESC>LTEMPLATE TTY:<CR>

Syntax:    >>TV  <field-name> <CR>
Defaults:            Text:

TV is a TOP-20 editor, available as a subcommand of the HERMES
DRAFT-EDITOR.

This program works correctly only if you have a DEC VT52 or VT100
terminal and have your TOPS-20 terminal type set to VT52 or
VT100.  If the terminal type is set to something else, TV gives
you regular DEC TECO.  TV is a scope version of DEC TECO, with a
visible cursor and an automatic display of 20 lines of the text
buffer.  The major difference between DEC TECO and BBN TECO is
that DEC uses <ESC> in place of the BBN <CTRL-D> and <ESC> <ESC>
in place of the BBN <ESC>.

NOTE: If you get into TV by mistake, <CTRL-C> will get you back
to the HERMES >> without loss.

The command TV causes Hermes to create an "inferior fork"
containing a copy of the program TV; that is, a copy of TV is
made "inside" Hermes, with the specified field of the message in
the TV buffer.  You may then use all of the available TV commands
to edit the field.

Return to HERMES with the results of your edit by typing

      ;H <ESC> <ESC>

The effect is that you are turned to the DRAFT-EDITOR with;the
results of the edit in the appropriate field.

To abandon the edit, type <CTRL-C>.

As with other editors, we assume you know how to use TV before
you invoke this command.  (See your local <DOCUMENTATION>
directory for more information about TV.)

At top command level:
Syntax:   >UNDELETE <messages> <CR>
Default:             CMESSAGE

UNDELETE removes the DELETED marking from a message; thereafter
it can once again be accessed by the output commands.

In the DRAFT-FILES-EDITOR or MESSAGE-FILES-EDITOR (d-> or m-> prompt):
Syntax:        UNDELETE <file-name> <CR>
Default:                   none

While you are in the editor, you can UNDELETE a file you
have DELETED.  Once you have left the editor with DONE, the
DELETED files are expunged and cannot be UNDELETED.

(EXAMPLE exists.)
     >DELETE 4:6,NEW,3<CR>
        4:6,13:15,3

Restore all messages that have been marked deleted.
     >UNDELETE ALL<CR>
     Messages 1,2,7:12 are already marked UNDELETED.
       3:6,13:15

An undeliverable message is a message which cannot be delivered
to the intended recipient.  Usually, the message is addressed to
a remote host, i.e., not your local computer, and the reason it
cannot be delivered is:

    (a)  There is something wrong with the username.  Either
         it does not exist on the remote host, or you have
         made a mistake in spelling.

    (b)  There is trouble at the remote host, and the message
         delivery process has not been able to connect to the
         remote host for five days.

In either case, the local delivery program, MAILER, sends you a
message and tells you why the message was undeliverable.  You can
use MAILSTAT, in Hermes, at the > prompt, to handle the
undeliverable message.

Syntax:    > UNGET <CR>

UNGET causes Hermes to release the current message-file without GETting
another message-file.

When you QUIT, EXIT or LOGOUT from the HERMES System, should any
changes that you have made to your Active Environment be stored
automatically in your PROFILE?

Your Active Environment consists of your filters, template
destinations, user fields, and switch settings.

NOTE: If the switch is set to No, you may still save an object in
your PROFILE by giving the EXPORT command.

  UPDATE-PROFILE       Ask       [X]Yes          No

To override this switch, type ",<CR>" instead of "<CR>" to end
the QUIT, EXIT or LOGOUT command.  Type ? to +> prompt to see the
override commands.  End override mode by typing <CR> to +>
prompt.

     You can freely create, destroy or modify sequences,
filters and templates.  This enables you to tailor HERMES to
meet your own message handling and formatting requirements.

     To create a new object, use the CREATE command and
specify the object type.  To destroy a user-created object,
use the ERASE command.

(EXAMPLE exists.)
     >CREATE SEQUENCE ALPHA<CR> [New object] <CR>
     s->

You are now in the SEQUENCE-EDITOR.

     >CREATE FILTER BETA<CR> [New object] <CR>
     f->

You are now in the FILTER-EDITOR.

     >CREATE TEMPLATE GAMMA<CR> [EDIT old version] <CR>
     t->

You are now in the TEMPLATE-EDITOR, ready to make changes in
the previously existing template named GAMMA.
HERMES allows you to create new header fields, called user
fields.  A user field name may be any combination of upper and
lower case letters, numbers and punctuation marks (not ? and :), 
as long as at least one character is a non-number.  This is
required to distinguish between user-fields and message-nos in
message specifications.

Five data-types are available:

  1) Name, Name-Line or Name-()
     is like the Subject: field, ends with <CR>.

  2) Name-(Addressee), Name-(Addr) or Name-(People)
     accepts addressee-lists but, unlike To:, does NOT transmit
     copies of the message to the addressees.

  3) Name-(Date)
     accepts a single date, like Start-Date:.

  4) Name-(number), Name-(no.), Name-(#) or Name-($)
     accepts integers, decimals places or exponentials, e.g.,
     1.41E5 or 141E3.

  4) Name-(Text) or [Name]
     accepts a multi-line text field, ends with <CTRL-Z>.

User fields can be created in any combination of upper and lower
case letters.  (However, HERMES recognizes "Name", "name", "NAME"
and "nAmE" as identical user fields.)

With user fields, you can tailor HERMES to meet your own needs.
You can make up your own user fields or lift them from incoming
messages, and then use them exactly like fixed fields.

Your collection of user fields is stored in a current object
named USER-FIELDS.  You may create new user fields with:
	
  a) The USER-FIELDS editor.

  b) The EXPLODE (or EDIT MESSAGE) command, if the message
     that is exploded has user fields.

  c) The COMMENT command.
  
  d) The COMPOSE command with the EDITOR INTERFACE.
Top-Level Commands (> prompt):
EDIT USER-FIELDS     Enters the USER-FIELDS editor.
                      Note: USER-FIELDS is one word.
SHOW USER FIELDS     Shows collection of user fields.
                      Note: USER FIELDS are two words.

Subcommands (u-> prompt):
DONE                 Makes changes permanent.  Returns to >.
ABORT                Aborts changes.  Returns to >.
ADD     name         Creates a new user field.
DECLARE name            "    "  "   "     "
ERASE   name or no.  Erases a user field.
SHOW                 Shows all user fields with line numbers.

The template item "Verbatim" prints the message exactly as it
was received.  It is used in the fixed template
LONG-PRINT-FORM.
	
     LONG-PRINT-FORM
     (1) Message-No.:+ "; " Char-Count:+ Status:+ 
     (2) Verbatim: 
		
Line (1) contains information about the message that was
generated when the message was received, but that is not
actually included in the message itself.
	
Syntax:  >VERSION <argument><CR>
Defaults:          Shortform
		

As each major modification of the HERMES System is released,
it is given a new version number.

The VERSION command prints out the HERMES herald line and
other information about the system in use.  If you have
trouble, the information provided by VERSION will be of great
help in debugging the system.
	
    Shortform -- prints only the HERMES Herald.
    Longform -- adds all file names and activated options.
    Everything -- adds the free storage report, maybe more.

Syntax:         >>WE <field-name> <CR>
Defaults:               Text:

WE is a text editor designed for use on HP 2640/45 terminals.
If you have such a terminal and wish to use WE, set your
TERMINAL-TYPE switch to HP-2640 or HP-2645.  You can enter WE by:

     1) Giving the WE command.
     2) entering a message field and then typing <CTRL-K>.  Any
        contents of the field that you have already created will
        be placed in the WE buffer.

Return to HERMES by hitting the function key:
 QUIT

HERMES prints: "Replace the Text field?" or whatever field has
been edited.

If you respond with Yes, HERMES inserts the edited version of the
buffer as the new message field.

If you type No, the edited version of the buffer disappears, and
HERMES does not change the contents of the message field.

In either case, you are returned to the DRAFT-EDITOR.

 Commands are given to WE by hitting various function keys.
 Text is entered by typing on the keyboard.

 The particular arrangement of the WE function keys is
 selected by your installation and can be individually
 modified.  All of the keys described in the topics listed
 below are available.

 The cursor determines where WE functions like deleting and
 overwriting affect the text.

 To move the cursor from line to line without changing its
 horizontal position use UP or DOWN.

 To move the cursor within a line use LEFT or RIGHT.

 Pressing a cursor movement key moves the cursor one line or
 one character.  Holding the key down causes the movement to
 be repeated until the key is released.  To move the cursor
 over a specific number of characters, type the number
 followed by the command.

 To move to a specific line in the text, type the line number
 and then hit the JUMP key.

The display presented by WE has two lines at the top which show
information about the state of the editor and the text being
edited.  The remainder of the display is a view of part of that
text.  The cursor is used for indicating positions in the text.
A guiding philosophy in the development of WE has been: You
should be able to edit only what you can see on your display.
That is: What you see is what you get.

Some consequences of this philosophy are:

       * Tabs cannot be distinguished visually from spaces.
         Therefore, we automatically enter the proper number of
         spaces whenever you type a tab.

       * Control characters are not visible.  Therefore, when
         needed in the text, they are entered as up-arrow
         followed by the character.

       * The screen has a fixed width.  Therefore the lines in
         the text may have at a maximum that length.  Longer
         lines are automatically broken into multiple lines.

 There are a set of control characters which have been
 implemented in WE to aid in correcting common typing errors:

    Control characters              Meaning
    <CTRL-H>, <CTRL-A>, <DEL>       ERASE CHAR LEFT
    <CTRL-W>                        ERASE WORD LEFT
    <CTRL-Q>, <CTRL-U>              ERASE LINE LEFT
    <CTRL-R>                        repaint the screen

 The ERASE/MOVE key changes the mode of WE back and forth
 between erase mode and move mode.  In move mode, LEFT, RIGHT,
 UP and DOWN simply move the cursor.  In erase mode, the same
 motions erase the characters over which the cursor moves.

 The FORMAT key is provided for "neatening" the edited text:
 lines are filled (and optionally justified).  Blank lines
 are interpreted as paragraph breaks and any indentation at
 the beginning of a paragraph is preserved.

 Formatting can be turned on and off within the text.  A line
 containing only "^I" (two characters, up-arrow and "I")*
 signals the start of text which is not to be formatted.  A
 line containing only "^I^I" signals the return to formatting.
 Formatting does not affect cursor position.

 NOTE: "^I" is used by WE to represent all TAB (or CTRL-I)
 characters present in the contents of the field passed to WE
 from HERMES.  The TAB key in WE inserts spaces.  On return
 to HERMES, "^I"s are changed back to TABs.  Thus formatting
 in WE and HERMES are compatible.

 Whenever you type text on the keyboard, it is added to the
 text you are editing at the cursor location.  When WE is in
 insert mode, the text is simply inserted.  When in overwrite
 mode, the inserted text overwrites, characters for character
 the text being edited.  To switch between insert mode and
 overwrite mode, use INSERT/OVERWRITE.

 WE permits the keyboard to be used to invoke the functions
 associated with the function keys.  When <CTRL-Z> is typed,
 the functions associated with the function keys become
 available on the keyboard.  Thus, the LEFT function is
 invoked by typing L, RIGHT by R, and so on.

 Typing another <CTRL-Z> changes the meaning of the keyboard
 from command to its "normal" meaning of characters to be
 added to the text.  Hitting <CTRL-Z> when in this text mode
 switches the keyboard back to command mode.

 As a special aid, the INSERT and OVERWRITE commands
 automatically switch from CMD to KEYS mode, on the assumption
 that when you hit one of these you are intending to add
 characters to the text.

 The keys corresponding to the function keys are:

         0-9  multiplying numbers
         W C  set WORD and CHAR mode (like toggling W/C)
         U D  UP and DOWN
         L R  LEFT and RIGHT
         E M  set ERASE and MOVE mode (like toggling E/M)
         I O  set INSERT and OVERWRITE mode (like toggling I/O)
         %    JUMP
         Q    DONE
         H    ABORT
         F    PROFILE

PROFILE is used to modify a collection of mode control
switches which determine finer details of the way in which WE
carries out its various actions.  Hitting this key produces a
display which explains the profile switches, their options,
and how to change them.  This is self-explanatory.

SEARCH is used to locate a word in text, and to place the
cursor near it.  Hit the SEARCH key, then type in the word to
be searched for.  Terminate with any of the following
characters: <CR>, SPACE, TAB or <CTRL-Z>.  The upper line of
the display shows the word being sought.  While you type in
this word, the following control characters have special
effects:

         <CTRL-A>,<CTRL-H>,DEL  ERASE CHARACTER LEFT.
         <CTRL-W>               ERASE WORD LEFT.
         <CTRL-Q>               Abort gathering search word.
         <CTRL-R>               Redisplay.
         <CTRL-E>               Toggles search mode between exact
                                and case-independent searching.
         <CTRL-S>, <CTRL-L>, <CTRL-F>, <CTRL-B>, <CTRL-N>
                                Set mode of cursor placement.


Search is carried out in one of two modes:

         Case-insensitive: "a" is regarded as the same as "A".
         Exact: "a" and "A" are considered to be different.

<CTRL-E> is used to specify the mode while typing in the
search word.

On finding the searched-for word in the text, the search
stops and the cursor is placed near the word.  This placement
happens in one of five ways, as controlled by the following
mode-specifying control characters which can be used while
typing in the search string:

         <CTRL-S>     on first character of search string (Start)
         <CTRL-L>     on last character of search string (Last)
         <CTRL-F>     on character to the right of search string
                (Following)
         <CTRL-B>     on the first character of the word
                      containing search string (Beginning)
         <CTRL-N>     on the first character of the word after
                      search string (Next)

 The unit of movement when using LEFT or RIGHT can be a
 character, a word or a line.  To change back and forth
 between word mode and character mode, use the WORD/CHAR key.
 If you want to move to either end of the line you are working
 on, hit LINE, then LEFT or RIGHT.
 
Hermes allows you to specify dates by day of the week
in a three-week span around today's date.
	
    LAST WEEK           THIS WEEK           NEXT WEEK
Sun . . . . . Sat | Sun . . . . . Sat | Sun . . . . . Sat
                              ^
                            Today
	
You can specify the days of the current week as:

   Monday, Tuesday ...
or
   This Monday, This Tuesday ...

"Last Monday" is the Monday of the preceding week, and 
"Next Monday" is the Monday of the following week.
	
   >SURVEY ON WEDNESDAY<ESC> (of this week)<CR>

   >SURVEY ON THIS FRIDAY<CR>

   >SURVEY START-DATE ON LAST MONDAY<CR>

   >SURVEY SUSPENSE-DATE ON NEXT WEDNESDAY<CR>

In the DRAFT-EDITOR, days of the week can be used to enter
dates in any Date-type field.

   >>Noteworthy-(Date) NEXT TUESDAY<CR>

   >>END-DATE THURSDAY<CR>
	

Syntax:  WHEREIS  <messages><CR>
Default:           CMESSAGE

The WHEREIS command is used to find which sequences contain
a specified message or set of messages.

(EXAMPLE exists.)
>WHEREIS 4<CR>
  4 is in ANSWERED, JONES
>WHEREIS To: JONES<CR>
  1,5,15 are in JONES
  2,7,11 are in ANSWERED
  3,6,8,9,12:14,16:20 are in [none]
  4,10 are in ANSWERED,JONES
Syntax:   >>XED   <field name> <CR>
Defaults:             Text:

     XED is a standard TENEX editor, available as a subcommand
of the HERMES draft-editor.

NOTE: If you get into XED by mistake, <CTRL-C> will get you
back to the HERMES >> without loss.

XED creates an "inferior fork" of TENEX XED, that is, a copy
of XED inside HERMES, with the specified field of the message in
the XED buffer.  You may then use all of the available XED
commands to edit the field.

Return to HERMES by typing E<CR>.  XED prints out "Returning
updated text to caller," and HERMES inserts the edited version of
the buffer as the new message field.

If you type Q<CR>, XED prints out "Returning to caller without
updating," the edited version of the buffer disappears, and
HERMES does not change the contents of the message field.

In either case, you are returned  to the DRAFT-EDITOR.

As with TECO, NETED and SPELL, we assume you know how to use
XED before you invoke this command.  (See your local computer
center for XED documentation.)

(EXAMPLE exists.)
>>XED<CR>
XED Version 0.00
... 20 lines
1: Exit
Returning updated text to caller [CONFIRM] <CR>
20 lines
>>

You can search a field like Subject or To by typing the field
name followed by a substring of the contents.  If the substring
contains a space, use quotes.

You can bind the search to the beginning or end of the field by
using the | character.

  >SURVEY Subject 502|<cr>	  Selects Subjects ending in 502.
  >SURVEY [Text] |"Note by SMITH" Selects [Text]: fields that
                                  begin with "Note by SMITH".
  >PRINT To |Editor-People        Selects To: fields that begin 
                                  with Editor-People.

If the substring contains a | character, select by including TWO
||'s in the substring.

  >SURVEY Subject ||<cr>          Selects Subjects that contain 
                                  ONE or more |'s.
