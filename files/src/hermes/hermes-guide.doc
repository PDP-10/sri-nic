      Read the Tutorial Summary first, then turn to the
      rest of THE HERMES GUIDE for more information.

      PART A is THE CONCISE GUIDE.  Level I covers the
      commands discussed in the Tutorial Summary.  Level II
      tells you how to change Hermes switches and other
      objects so that you can customize Hermes to suit
      yourself.

      PART B tells you how to place a whole draft message in
      an auxiliary editor so that you can move freely from
      field to field.  The EMACS editor has been specially
      customized for use with Hermes.

      Just the Basics, Please ...      Just the Basics, Please ...


                   This Tutorial Summary tells you what you need to know to
                   read and send messages.  Nothing too fancy.  If you
                   study the examples, you should be able to start using
                   Hermes right away.

                   Since it is a bit awkward to put "you" into examples, we
                   follow the messages received and sent by J. Bobolink,
                   who logs in as BOBOLINK on BBNG, a TOPS-20 computer.

                   EXAMPLE 1 shows you how to get started.  The TENEX or
                   TOPS-20 prompt is @, and the Hermes prompt is >.  The
                   characters that you type are underlined and in boldface.
                                                         ____                                                         <cr>                   The carriage return is represented by <cr>.

                   When you enter Hermes, the program automatically GETs
                   your Inbox, which is a file named MAIL.TXT.1 on TOPS-20,
                   or MESSAGE.TXT;1 on TENEX.  The Inbox is now the current
                   message-file (CMESSAGE-FILE).  Hermes prints an Initial
                   Survey of all recent messages on the terminal.

                   The linefeed key, <lf>, prints the first message in
                   the initial survey, and then each NEXT message.

                   <Ctrl-O> stops printing on your terminal. (Hold down the

      Subject: Change of place for meeting.
               [BIRDER Project]
      Meeting-(Date): 23 June 1982, Wednesday
      Meeting-Place: SMALL conference room, second floor.
      
      The previous place has been appropriated by our visitors from
      Audubon.

      =====================================================================

                   You can command Hermes to survey all the messages in
                   your inbox.  This is the default version of the SURVEY
                   command.  SURVEY prints the current sequence, CSEQUENCE,
                   which is initially set to all the messages in your
                   message-file.  The form in which the message is printed
                   is determined by the STEMPLATE, initially set for short
                   summaries.  The destination is the terminal, TTY:.  

                   You can see the defaults by hitting <esc> repeatedly.
                   The <esc> key (a) introduces each new section of a
                   command with a "cue" word or phrase, in parentheses, and
                   then (b) enters the default for that section.

                   The <esc> also closes the message specification, which
                   could be complex.  In order to make the examples read
                   better, the <esc> is usually not shown from here on.

                   The PRINT command defaults to the current message
                   (CMESSAGE or "."), which is the message just printed.
                   The <esc> prints the actual message-no.  (The CSEQUENCE
                   could be a very long list of numbers.)  SURVEY and PRINT
                   always default to TTY:, but the LIST command defaults to
                   the LDESTINATION, intially set to LPT:, which is the
                   lineprinter of the host computer.

                   You can mark messages deleted and then UNDELETE.  You
                   can remove deleted messages completely with the EXPUNGE
                   command.  The default is to renumber the remaining 
                   messages, but the "NORENUMBER" subcommand turns each
                   deleted message into a zero-length message which "saves
                   its place" in the message-file.

                   <Ctrl-P> enters the message specification used in the
                   previous command, and saves typing.

                   The FILE command copies messages from the CMESSAGE-FILE
                   into a destination message-file. There is a current
                   destination, the FDESTINATION, no initial default.  If
                   you want to FILE to a default file, you must use the SET
                   command.

                   A message-file may be any length, from one to a few
                   thousand messages.  You can GET different messages.  If
                   you forget which file you have accessed with the GET
                   command, you can use the STATUS command.  GET defaults
                   to the Inbox.

                   You can organize messages into "sequences" in a file.
                   Sequences are like file folders, but better, because you
                   can put one message into any number of sequences.

                   If you DELETE and EXPUNGE with renumbering, the message-
                   nos. in the sequences are automatically updated.  

                   You can use the commands SHOW, WHEREIS or HOWMANY on
                   sequences.  The SHOW command has a lot of choices for
                   displaying sequences and other Hermes objects in
                   different ways.

                   If you simply type <cr>, SHOW defaults to the CDRAFT at
                   both > and >>.  However, if you type <esc>, Hermes will
                   ring the bell, rather than print out the word "CDRAFT".
                   This is a very good time to use the "?".

      ---------------------------------------------------------------------

                   The DRAFT-EDITOR is the place where the draft message
                   (CDRAFT) is stored before it is transmitted with SEND.
                   It has a distinctive >> prompt.  You have a choice of
                   two Interface Styles for composing a draft message
                   (CDRAFT).  The default is Command-Line.

                   Command-Line:                   Command-Line:  Constructs the CDRAFT by prompting you to
                   fill in a series of fields.  Each field can be edited
                   with Hermes commands or an auxiliary editor.

                   Editor:                   Editor:  See PART B: THE EDITOR INTERFACE TO THE WHOLE
                   DRAFT.  Useful for screen terminals.  Hermes constructs
                   the CDRAFT as a skeleton message, then copies it into
                   the buffer of an auxiliary editor.  When you are through
                   editing, the editor buffer is copied back into the
                   CDRAFT.  The EMACS editor is customized for Hermes.

                   COMPOSE, FORWARD and REPLY are the most commonly used
                   commands for composing the CDRAFT.  FORWARD and REPLY
                   require you to GET the correct CMESSAGE-FILE.

                   The FORWARD command automatically protects the included
                   message from the effects of the FORMAT function.  The
                   first <tab> line turns formatting OFF, the second line
                   with <tab><tab> turns formatting back ON.

                                       xvii      Saving Drafts and Fields             HERMES GUIDE -- TUTORIAL SUMMARY
      ---------------------------------------------------------------------

                   In the DRAFT-EDITOR, at the >> prompt, the CDRAFT is a
                   Hermes object which disappears when you QUIT and then
                   give the command to start a new session of HERMES.

                   If you do not want to send a CDRAFT immediately, you can
                   save it, or part of it, in a TOPS-20 file.  Commands for
                   saving the entire CDRAFT in a draft-file are STORE-DRAFT
                   and RESTORE-DRAFT.  Commands for saving a single field
                   are SAVE-FIELD and APPEND-FILE.  Type a <ctrl-B> within
                   a field to insert a draft-file.

                   The command for copying a message from a message-file
                   into the CDRAFT is EXPLODE.

      1.  INTRODUCTION      1.  INTRODUCTION

      Hermes is an advanced electronic message system developed at Bolt
      Beranek and Newman, Inc., Cambridge, Mass., with the support of
      the Department of Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency,
      under Contract No.  F30602-81-C-0256.  Hermes is installed on
      twenty-six ARPANET host computers.

      Hermes runs on systems that use the TENEX or TOPS-20 Exec (i.e.,
      command processor), and is designed to use ARPANET standards and
      to cooperate with ARPANET mail delivery and forwarding programs.

      Although it was originally designed in 1975 for use with simple
      hardcopy terminals, Hermes has been enhanced to handle a variety
      screen terminals, and to cooperate with the powerful EMACS
      screen-oriented editor program.  Other editors and a spelling
      correction program can also be used from within Hermes.

      You can control Hermes through the use of commands.  These act
      upon directories, files, messages and Hermes objects.  You can
      tailor the system to your wishes through the use of Hermes
      objects, especially "switches" and "templates".  In this Guide,
      most switches are shown on the same page as the commands they
      control. Hermes is currently used for many applications other
      than messages, such as the production of structured documents,
      bibliographies and mailing lists.


      1.1 TENEX/TOPS-20 Directories      1.1 TENEX/TOPS-20 Directories

      Your directory is a work and storage space on the computer,
      identified by your user-name.  Consult the staff of your host
      computer for regulations about the amount of storage you are
      allowed in your directory, and the type of access that you have
      to other directories.


      1.2 Files and Filenames      1.2 Files and Filenames

      The basic unit of storage in a directory is the file.  On TENEX
      and TOPS-20 host computers, filenames are similar but not alike.
      The place where you receive messages is your Inbox which, 
      if your username were BOBOLINK, would be a file named:

                                    - 3 -      1.3 - 1.3.1                       HERMES GUIDE -- Part A: Level I
      -----------------------------------------------------------------

          <BOBOLINK>MESSAGE.TXT;1  on a TENEX host

      or

          PS:<BOBOLINK>MAIL.TXT.1  on a TOPS-20 host.

      "PS:" is the name of the  TOPS-20 disk structure, i.e, the 
      "Public Structure", which is where mailbox files are usually .
      located.  If the TOPS-20 host has only one disk structure, the
      "PS:" is omitted.


      1.3 Files That Hermes Creates      1.3 Files That Hermes Creates

      Hermes automatically creates some files in your login directory.
      Usually, you don't have to pay any attention to them, but you
      should be aware that they exist, so that you don't delete any of
      them by accident.  See Appendix D. TROUBLESHOOTING, page 73, for
      more information about them.


      1.3.1 Parseq Files      1.3.1 Parseq Files

      For each message-file, Hermes creates a corresponding companion
      file which is called the "parseq" file.  The parseq file takes
      its name from the fact that it stores the "PARse" of the message-
      file and any "SEQuences" that you have created.  The parse is an
      index to the message-file, which allows Hermes to search it
      quickly.  Sequences are useful tools for organizing the messages
      in the file, and are explained in Section 3.3, on page 8.

      3.3 Sequences -- Objects for Organizing Messages in a File      3.3 Sequences -- Objects for Organizing Messages in a File

      A sequence is a Hermes "object", which consists of a sequence of
      message-numbers that has a name.  Sequences are stored with the
      message-file, in the companion "parseq" file -- the one with the
      ^'s, e.g., ^MAIL.TXT^.1.  Sequences do NOT follow messages when
      messages are filed into another file.

      When DELETED messages are EXPUNGED -- if the remaining messages
      are renumbered -- the sequences are automatically updated.

      A sequence can be used as a message specification in any
      command.
                      Ex.: >PRINT PREVIOUSSEQUENCE<cr>
                           >CONSIDER REVERSE<cr>


      Current:      Current:           EDIT contents or set with SET or CONSIDER.

       CSEQUENCE         Default sequence used in the SURVEY command.

      4.1 The Interface Style: Command-Line vs. Editor      4.1 The Interface Style: Command-Line vs. Editor

      The INTERFACE-STYLE switch controls whether you compose the
      CDRAFT field by field (Command-Line style) or place the whole
      draft in the buffer of an auxiliary editor (Editor style).



      4.2  COMMAND-LINE Interface Style      4.2  COMMAND-LINE Interface Style

      The CDRAFT is a collection of individual fields.  A command such
      as COMPOSE prompts for fields one by one, by printing the name of
      each field in turn and letting you type in the contents.  When
      you have gone through the prompts, you can make further changes
      by editing each field individually using Hermes commands.  To do
      this, use the Hermes DRAFT-EDITOR, a collection of commands at
      the >> prompt.



      4.3  EDITOR Interface Style (See Part B.)      4.3  EDITOR Interface Style (See Part B.)

      A command such as COMPOSE constructs the CDRAFT, then copies it
      into an auxiliary editor, such as EMACS.  The "prompted" fields
      are displayed as empty fields in the editor buffer.  When you are
      though editing, the editor copies the buffer into the CDRAFT.

      If you use the EDITOR interface style, you will make less use of
      commands at the >> prompt, but you will still use some of them.

      defaults to Text:.  If you omit the "lines" specification and
      type only the field name, the "lines" defaults to the whole
      field.  The SHOW-FIELD switch controls whether lines are shown
      numbered.  The symbol for the last line is "%".

      The CHANGE command is an intra-line editor, with its own set of
      single-character subcommands, similar to the ones in the XED
      editor.  There is no prompt; the subcommands themselves are not
      printed on the terminal, but they cause some conventional signs
      to be printed.

      CHANGE line field numbered/unnumbered
                       Lets you change a line by copying from an "old"
                       version into a "new" version.

      Subcommands of CHANGE, no prompt:

        <space>        Copies one character from old line to new.

        <cr>           Copies the rest of line and ends CHANGE.

        E              Copies to End of line.

        Sc             Searches for any character c.  Attempts to match
                       case (upper or lower) of c, then searches for
                       the other case.  Copies up to c.

        S<space>       Searches for a space; thus copies to the end of
                       the next word.

        B              Breaks line into two lines.  (To combine two
                       lines, leave CHANGE and use FORMAT.)

        I              Begins an Insertion.  End with <cr> or <ctrl-Z>.
                       Rings bell or prints ! (See CHANGE-BELL switch.)

        D              Deletes next character to right.  Prints /.

      4.8  Commands For Auxiliary Text Editors      4.8  Commands For Auxiliary Text Editors

      The EDIT command and the auxiliary editors default to acting on
      the whole draft, although it is possible to force the edit of a
      single field.  (See Section 13.3 on page 51.)  If you get into an
      editor by mistake, you can get out safely with <ctrl-C>.

      EMACS  field     End with C-X C-Z; abort with M-X Hermes Abort.

      NETED  field     End with QUIT or SAVE. Hermes asks about saving
                       text.

      TECO   field     End with ;h$.  Hermes asks about saving text.
      TV     field     End with ;h$.  Hermes asks about saving text.

      XED    field     End with E; abort with Q.

      WE     field     End with QUIT; abort with ABORT.

      <ctrl-K>         Inside a field, drops into the auxiliary editor
                       specified by the EDITOR-DEFAULT switch.

      EDIT   field     Places the whole draft, or a single field into
                       the auxiliary editor specified by the EDITOR-
                       DEFAULT switch.

      EMACS is the only editor that has been extensively customized to
      cooperate with Hermes.  The whole draft, or a single field, is
      passed to a special buffer named *Hermes*.  Only this buffer is
      passed back into the CDRAFT when you quit EMACS.



      4.9  Commands for Encryption      4.9  Commands for Encryption

      Encryption is available for the Text: field only.  When you read
      encrypted messages with PRINT or LIST, Hermes prompts for a key.

      DECRYPT          Prompts for key, decrypts Text: field of CDRAFT.

      ENCRYPT          Prompts for key, requires you to type the key
                       twice, then encrypts Text: field of CDRAFT.

      4.10.1  Backup for the CDRAFT      4.10.1  Backup for the CDRAFT

      There is automatic backup for the current draft (CDRAFT) in the
      DRAFT-EDITOR.  Hermes creates or updates two draft-files every
      every two minutes when you are composing in Command-Line style
      and are not using an auxiliary editor.  Hermes also updates these
      files whenever you return from an auxiliary editor.

      $DRAFT-BACKUP-month-day-time contains a copy of the CDRAFT.

      $TEXT-BACKUP-month-day-time contains a copy of the contents of
      the Text: field (or any other TEXT-type field) that you are
      currently typing in.

         A. If you SEND or ABORT the draft, or leave Hermes normally,
            with the QUIT, EXIT or LOGOUT command, these files are
            automatically deleted.

         B. If you do NOT leave Hermes normally, these files remain in
            your directory.  They should contain the entire CDRAFT
            except for text added during the last two minutes.  When
            you enter Hermes, you are told about all these files and
            given a chance to delete those over 24 hours old.


      4.10.2  How to Restore Your Draft from the Backup Files      4.10.2  How to Restore Your Draft from the Backup Files

      Suppose the computer or Hermes crashes while you are in the
      middle of typing in the Text: field.

         A. Start up a new Hermes, by logging in again if necessary.

                             ___           ___________                             RES           $D<esc><cr>         B. Give the command RESTORE-DRAFT $D<esc><cr>.  This is the
            correct command for a draft-file that contains a complete
            draft, consisting of several fields.  (If there is more
            than one $DRAFT... file, you can use Hermes filenames to
            extend the filename to the point of ambiguity. See Section
            6.4, page 23.)  Next, type SHOW to the >> prompt.  If the
                                               ___         ___________                                               APP         $T<esc><cr>            Text is missing or incomplete, use APPEND-FILE $T<esc><cr>.

      
      4.10.3  The $HERMES-EMACS-BACKUP.HRM file created by EMACS      4.10.3  The $HERMES-EMACS-BACKUP.HRM file created by EMACS

      EMACS is the only editor that has been extensively customized to
      cooperate with Hermes.  When you use EMACS, the text that is
      returned to Hermes is the text in the *Hermes* buffer.  EMACS
      periodically makes a backup file for this buffer, approximately
      every two minutes, and at the end of the EMACS session.  This
      file is permanent -- each EMACS session creates a new version
      number.  It can be recovered with RESTORE-DRAFT, or with APPEND-
      FILE or <ctrl-B>, if you have forced the edit of a single field.

      -----------------------------------------------------------------

      5.   HOW TO TYPE COMMANDS      5.   HOW TO TYPE COMMANDS

      Hermes is friendly. It recognizes command words and object names
      as soon as you have typed enough of the word, and corrects
      misspellings, as well, e.g., >SNED(=SEND).

      Hermes prompts you to type a command by printing a "prompt
      character".  The prompt is > for the primary Hermes commands,
      and >> in the Draft Editor.  Other object editors have their own
      prompts, such as s-> or x->.  The prompt for TENEX/TOPS-20 is @.

      Characters that cannot be printed, such as Carriage-Return, and
      the "control characters", are conventionally represented by
      letters enclosed in angle brackets, e.g., <cr> and <ctrl-E>.

      To type a control character, hold down the key marked CTRL and
      type the letter key simultaneously.


      5.1  Panic Buttons      5.1  Panic Buttons

      <ctrl-E>     Aborts a command after the <cr> or <ctrl-Z>.

      <ctrl-U>     Erases the command line before <cr> or <ctrl-Z>.

      <ctrl-O>     Stops printout on your terminal.

      <ctrl-T>     Shows system is working, tells system load.

      <ctrl-C>     Stops Hermes.  Does not release message-file; does
                   not update PROFILE.  Recover by typing CONTINUE to
                   the @ prompt.  NOTE: In auxiliary editors, <ctrl-C>
                   asks you to confirm, then aborts the edit.

      ?            Prints a list of your choices at the point where
                   you are, even within a word in a command.

      Some commands allow you to type extra words, to modify the
      command.  You can separate the words in the command with either
      a space or <esc>:

      <esc>        ESCAPE key.  Prints "cue" words in parentheses.
                   Hit <esc> repeatedly to enter cues and defaults.

      <cr>         CARRIAGE RETURN.  All commands must end with <cr>,
                   except for
                     a) the Text: field, which ends with <ctrl-Z>.
                     b) user-created text-type fields, also <ctrl-Z>.
                     c) single-character commands, ^ and <linefeed>.

         A.  Responding to [Confirm].  Some commands, such as SEND and
             ERASE, cause irreversible actions.  After <cr>, Hermes
             prints "[Confirm]" on your terminal.  You may:

               1)  Confirm with another <cr>, or

               2)  Abort the command by typing the RUBOUT or DELETE key
                   on TENEX, or the <ctrl-U> on TOPS-20.

         B.  Responding to Questions, such as "Send?":

               1)  Type either Y<cr> or N<cr> in response to a
                   question.

               2)  Type <cr>.  Hermes interprets this as "Yes", but
                   prints [Confirm], which requires another <cr>.

      
      5.4  Editing Characters (For Commands and Within Fields)      5.4  Editing Characters (For Commands and Within Fields)

      <ctrl-A>     TENEX: Deletes a single character.

      <ctrl-R>     Retypes a line of text.

      <ctrl-Z>     Ends the Text: field, or any TEXT-type field.

      <ctrl-I>     Inside a field, inserts a tab.  Tab stops are set
                   every 8 spaces.  One tab alone on a line turns the
                   FORMAT command OFF.  Two tabs alone turn it back ON.

      6.4 Hermes Filenames vs. TENEX/TOPS-20 Filenames      6.4 Hermes Filenames vs. TENEX/TOPS-20 Filenames

      If your FILENAME-INPUT switch is set to HERMES, the Hermes
      program takes over the management of the files that you use,
      instead of simply passing through the filenames from the TENEX
      or TOPS-20 operating system.  Hermes recognizes three types of
             _____________  ___________     _____________      files: message-files, draft-files and profile-files.

      You can escape from Hermes filenames by typing "!" before you
      type in a filename.

      There are two major advantages of Hermes filenames:

         1.  Hermes recognizes filenames in the same way that it
             recognizes the names of Hermes objects.  It extends them
             and spelling-corrects them.

         2.  You can type "?" at any point, even within a filename,
             e.g., ">GET ?" or ">FILE 10:25 SAV?" Hermes responds with
             all the appropriate files in your connected directory.

      
      6.4.1 Message-files in Hermes Filenames      6.4.1 Message-files in Hermes Filenames

      _____________      Message-files created in Hermes are given the extension .TXT,
      e.g., BIRDERS.TXT.1.  Hermes recognizes only .TXT files as
      message-files, but displays them as single-word names, e.g.,
      BIRDERS.  You can SHOW MESSAGE-FILES.

      There is a MESSAGE-FILES editor.  To enter, type EDIT MESSAGE-
      FILES.  The prompt is m->, and the significant commands are
      DELETE and UNDELETE.  The DELETE command marks a message-file
      for deletion.  When you leave the editor with DONE, Hermes
      deletes both the message-file and its corresponding parseq file,
      e.g., ^BIRDERS.TXT^.1, at the same time.

      6.4.2 Draft-files in Hermes Filenames      6.4.2 Draft-files in Hermes Filenames

      ___________      Draft-files are given the extension .HRM, i.e., SAVED.HRM.1.
      Hermes recognizes only .HRM files as draft-files, but displays
      them as single-word names, e.g., SAVED.  You can SHOW DRAFT-

      _____________      Profile-files created by EXPORT ACTIVE-ENVIRONMENT <file> are
   given the extension .PRFL, e.g., ORNITHOLOGY-BIBLIO.PRFL.1.
   Hermes recognizes .PRFL files as profile-files, and displays them
   as single-word names, e.g., ORNITHOLOGY-BIBLIO.  The default
   Hermes profile file, ^-HERMES'-^.PROFILE, is displayed as ^-
   HERMES'-^.  There is no profile-files editor.  To see the display

      7.1  The Basic Hermes Message      7.1  The Basic Hermes Message

      This is an example of the basic Hermes message, composed with
      the COMPOSE command, as it is initially set up, and then sent
      and received.  (It is one of the examples in the TUTORIAL
      SUMMARY.)  The original draft had four fields, To:, Cc:,
      Subject: and Text:.  All the other "header fields" were added
      automatically along the way.  You can see the message almost as
      it appears in the message-file if you print it through the
      LONG-PRINT-FORM template:

      7.2  Understanding How Templates Change the Print-Out      7.2  Understanding How Templates Change the Print-Out

      (To learn how to create your own templates, see Section 9.4,
      page 38.)

      The LONG-PRINT-FORM template used to print the example is:

          LONG-PRINT-FORM
          (1) Message-No.:+ "; " Char-Count:+ Status:+
          (2) Verbatim:

      The first line in the template prints three "pseudo-fields" that
      are not actually part of the message.


                                   - 24 -      HERMES GUIDE -- Part A: Level II                             7.2.1
      ------------------------------------------------------------------

      Message-No   The position of the message in the file.
      Char-count   The number of characters in the message.
      Status       Flags messages that are UNSEEN, RECENT and/or
                   marked REMIND.

      The actual first line of the message in the message-file is a
      "machine-readable header line" which was added by the mail
      delivery program when the message was received.  This header
      line is never shown by Hermes but contains information about the
      date that the message was placed in the message-file, the Char-
      count and the Status.

          15-Jun-82 10:24:37,496;000000000000

      The date in the machine-readable header line is compared to the
      date that you last looked at the message-file, to determine
      whether a message is RECENT or not.  The string of twelve 0's
      record other information, for example:

          000000000000  UNSEEN
          000000000001  SEEN
          000000000002  DELETED
          000000000003  SEEN and DELETED

      When you use the MARK command to mark message REMIND, the REMIND
      information is stored in the machine-readable header.  So is the
      information that lets a message be EXPLODED and then REFILED.

      The Mail-From:  and Received-Date:  fields were added by the
      delivery program.  Some older messages have a different line:

          Mail from BBN-TENEXE rcvd at 12-Nov-79 1024-EST.

      The remaining lines are a verbatim copy of the message as sent.
      The Date:, Sender:, From: and Message-ID: fields were added by
      the Hermes that sent the message, to give automatic authentica-
      tion.  The From: field, in this case, is a copy of the Sender:
      field, but, alternatively, it could be filled in by the user.
      The other automatic fields cannot be controlled by the user.

      

      7.2.1  The Message Printed Through the Usual SURVEY Template      7.2.1  The Message Printed Through the Usual SURVEY Template

      When you first enter Hermes, you are given an initial profile
      (see Section 9).  The SURVEY command defaults to the STEMPLATE,
      and, in your initial profile, the STEMPLATE is set to a copy of
      the SURVEY-FORM template.  Here is how the message in Section
      7.1 looks printed with the initial default SURVEY command:

       ___    ______       SUR    28<cr>      >SURVEY 28<cr>

      -+  28  496 15 Jun 82 ROBIN at BBNA Demonstration message.

      -----------------------------------------------------------------

      The SURVEY-FORM template itself looks like:

      SURVEY-FORM
      (1) Status: Message-No.: Char-Count: Rcvd-Date: Source: Subject:

      Rcvd-Date: is the date portion of either the Received-Date:  or
      the "Mail from ..." line.  The time is omitted to save space.


      7.2.2  The Message Printed Through the Usual PRINT Template      7.2.2  The Message Printed Through the Usual PRINT Template

      The PRINT command defaults to the PTEMPLATE. In your initial
      profile, the PTEMPLATE is set to a copy of the PRINT-FORM
      template.  The initial default PRINT command therefore prints
      the message in Section 7.1 as:

       __    ______      >PRINT 28<cr>      >PRINT 28<cr>
                                                                    _

          This is the multi-line Text: field, which usually contains |

                                                                   Text

      7.3.2  Major Fixed Fields NOT Printed by PRINT-FORM      7.3.2  Major Fixed Fields NOT Printed by PRINT-FORM

      Some fixed fields are NOT printed by the PRINT-FORM template
      because most users prefer to see short headers.  However, some
      of the fields are useful from time to time to track the identity
      of the person who actually sent a message (in the Sender: field),
      or the exact time that a message was sent (in the Date: field),
      or both (in the Message-ID: field).  It is always possible to
      see the message exactly as it appears in the message-file by
      using either the VERBATIM or the LONG-PRINT-FORM template.  You
      can EDIT your PTEMPLATE to add any of these fields.

      The Date:, Sender: and Message-ID: fields are automatically
      filled in or changed by Hermes, whenever a draft is SENT or
      REFILED as a new message, but not when a draft is REFILED over
      an existing message.

      Date:               Date and time that the message was sent.

      Sender:             Login username of the sender.

      Message-ID:         Unique identifier based on sender and date.

      A user field name may be any combination of upper and lower case
      letters, but it must not begin with a number and it must not
      contain a space.

      Name, Name-(line) or Name-()
                      Like the Subject: field, ends with <cr>.

      Name-(Addressee), Name-(Addr) or Name-(People)
                      For addressee-lists but, unlike To:, does NOT
                      transmit copies of the message to addressees.

      Name-(Number), Name-(No.), Name-($) or Name-(#)
                      Accepts numbers only integers, decimals or
                      numbers in the form 123.45E12.

      Name-(Date)     Accepts a single date, like Start-Date:.

      Name-(Text), [Name]  
                      A multi-line text field, ends with <ctrl-Z>.

      Your collection of user fields is stored in a current object
      named USER-FIELDS.  You may create new user fields:

        A.  By using the USER-FIELDS Editor.

        B.  By using EXPLODE on a message that contains user fields.

        C.  By using COMMENT to create a Comment-field.

      4) A  SEQUENCE.  This is a list of message-numbers that is stored
         under a name.

         Ex: CSEQUENCE, RECENTMESSAGES, PREVIOUSSEQUENCE,
             or any user-created sequence.

      5) A specification that tells Hermes to search for a message.
         Hermes will look though all the messages in the current
         sequence (CSEQUENCE) and select the ones that fit your speci-
         fication.  (See Section 8.2, page 31.)  The CSEQUENCE is
         initially set to all the messages in your message-file, when
         you enter of GET a message, but you can set it to a smaller
         group of messages by using the CONSIDER command, or SET
         CSEQUENCE.

      8.2  Searching the CSEQUENCE      8.2  Searching the CSEQUENCE

      Message specifications search the current sequence, CSEQUENCE.
      When you enter Hermes the CSEQUENCE is set to * (= ALLMESSAGES).
      Use the CONSIDER command to change the CSEQUENCE.

      1) A field.  This selects every message that contains that
         field, regardless of contents.
             ___    Bcc<cr>             SUR    Bcc<cr>         Ex: SURVEY Bcc<cr> selects messages with Bcc's.

      
      2) Before, On or After <date>, selects by the Date: field.  
             ___    _  ________ _ ________             SUR    O  December 1 1981<cr>         Ex: SURVEY On December 1 1981<cr>

         NOTE ABOUT DATES: Explicit dates must have day, month and
         year, in any reasonable form.  Weekdays specify dates in a
         three-week window centered on this week. "Last Monday" is
         Monday of last week (even if today is Tuesday), and "Monday"
         or "This Monday" is Monday of this week.  "Next Monday" is
         Monday of next week.

      3) A DATE-type field, followed by Before, On or After, followed
         by a date, selects by the date in that field.
              __    ___       _      ___________              PR    Rcv       B      10/6/81<cr>         Ex:  PRINT Rcvd-Date Before 10/6/81<cr>

      4) A non-Date field, followed by a "substring", that is, a
         partial specification of the contents.  If the substring
         contains a space, use quotes.

         NOTE ABOUT SUBSTRING SEARCHES: You can bind the search to the
         beginning or end of the field by using the | character.  If
         you want to search for the | character itself, use TWO |"s,
         e.g., || (that is, quote the character with itself).

         a) A LINE-type or a TEXT-type field, but NOT the Text: field.
                __   ___      _______ ____________                LI   Sub      "Stormy weather"<cr>            Ex: LIST Subject: "Stormy weather"<cr>

                __    ____ ________                PR    ZIP: |021<cr>                PRINT ZIP: |021<cr>

         b) An addressee field (To:, Cc:, Bcc: or a user field).
                __    __  _______                PR    To  Smi<cr>            Ex: PRINT To: Smi<cr>  Selects both "Smith" and "Smiley".

         NOTE ABOUT ADDRESSEE FIELDS: Hermes rejects unknown hosts,
         and local names that it cannot recognize. Hermes will not
         search within parentheses in addressee fields.  Sender: is an
         addressee field, but From: is a line-type field.

      5) A FILTER.  This is a set of criteria that is stored as a
         Hermes object, under an object name.

             ___    ___    ____             SUR    DEL    <cr>         Ex: SURVEY DELETED<cr>   Selects only deleted messages, and
                                  prints surveys (as a special case).

      8.3  Combining Selections      8.3  Combining Selections

      In ANY command that allows you to type in message specifications
      ("msg" or "(messages)") you can combine selection specifications
      with four operators:  , / ; NOT


      COMMA
         The "," operator builds up specifications.  HERMES selects
         the messages that fit any one.  Duplicates are removed.  This
         is the "union" operation.

              ___    __   ______ __ _________              SUR    FR   ROBIN, TO ROBIN<cr>         Ex:  SURVEY FROM ROBIN, TO ROBIN<cr>

      SLASH
         The "/" narrows down specifications.  The specification after
         the "/" places a restriction on anything before the "/".
         Message-nos. cannot be used after "/".

              ___    __   __________    ___________              SUR    FR   ROBIN/SUBJ    WEATHER<cr>         Ex:  SURVEY FROM ROBIN/SUBJECT WEATHER<cr>

      
      NOT
         "NOT" selects messages that do NOT fit the specifications.

             ___    ___ __   _________             SUR    NOT FR   ROBIN<cr>         Ex: SURVEY NOT FROM ROBIN<cr>

      
      SEMICOLON
         The ";" closes a specification and starts a new one.  The
         action of "/" stops at the preceding ";".  Between two "/" or
         "NOT" operators, "," acts like a ";".

              ___    __   ______ __   _________     _ ___ ______              SUR    FR   ROBIN; FR   GFINCH/BE     1 JUN 82<cr>         Ex:  SURVEY FROM ROBIN; FROM GFINCH/BEFORE 1 JUN 82<cr>

         This example selects all messages from Robin but only
         messages before 1 June 1982 that are from GFinch.

      A "filter" is a Hermes object for searching a message-file.  A
      filter may be a complete message specification, or a part of a
      message specification.  Filters are stored in the PROFILE.

      9.  TEMPLATES      9.  TEMPLATES

      "Templates" are Hermes objects stored in your PROFILE which are
      used in commands to specify the form of messages or the CDRAFT.
      Templates are designed for one of three kinds of use:


             File templates         A.  File templates, used with THRUFILE, change a message as
             it is filed into another message-file.


             Print templates         B.  Print templates control the form of printed messages.
             Template items for filing and printing templates include:

                1.  Fields -- These cause the corresponding fields in
                    the messages to be printed.  A + following a field
                    causes the name of the field to be printed.

                2.  Already filled-in literal fields.

                3.  Quoted strings -- These consist of text that is
                    NOT part of a field, enclosed in pairs of double
                    quotes, "...".

             Literal fields and quoted strings are indistinguishable
             from the contents of the messages being printed.


             Compose templates         C.  Compose templates control the selection and order of
             the fields in the CDRAFT for COMPOSE and similar
             commands.

                1.  Fields are presented to the user as a series of
                    prompts in Command-line style, or as empty fields
                    in the Editor Interface style.

                2.  Literal fields are included in the message as if
                    they were typed by the user.

                3.  Quoted strings may be used only for instructions
                    to the user; they are printed on the terminal but
                    are not included in the CDRAFT.


      A template contains numbered lines, each consisting of zero, one
      or more template items.  See Section 7.2, page 24, for examples,
      and Section 9.5, page 39, for detailed information about
      template items.

                             template.

      User:      User:                  CREATE your own templates. Use them with
                             THRUFILE to suppress, rename or add
                             fields to messages as they are filed.

      Fixed:      Fixed:                 Filed templates cannot be EDITed or SET.

       VERBATIM              Contains the Verbatim: item.  Copies the
                             message exactly as it appears in the
                             message-file.

      9.3  Print Templates      9.3  Print Templates

      The printing commands PRINT and SURVEY produce output on your
      terminal.  The LIST command produces output on your Line-
      Printer, if one is available.  The FORWARD and INCLUDE commands
      "print" into the text field of your draft message.

      The form of the "printed" output is specified by a print
      template.  Each command defaults to its own "current template".
      You can override the current template by typing the name of a

      9.4  Compose Templates      9.4  Compose Templates

      The composing commands, COMPOSE, REPLY and FORWARD, present the
      user with a series of prompts for message-fields.  These prompts
      are specified by a compose template.  Each command defaults to
      its own "current template".  The contents of the current
      templates can be EDITed or SET to a user-created template.  You
      can override the current template by typing the name of a
      different template.

                             parse the file correctly.  Use delimiters
                             in literal fields (see Section 9.6, page

      9.6  Template Items      9.6  Template Items

      Any field name may be used as a template item.  Other special
      groups of template items are:


             _______ _______             Literal fields.         A.  Literal fields.  These are specified by typing the word
             LITERAL followed by the field name, followed by the field
             contents, and ending with either <cr> or <ctrl-Z>.
                     ___     __  __________ _________                     lit     Cc  Chickadee, Robin<cr>             Ex:  t->literal Cc: Chickadee, Robin<cr>

             Then Hermes encloses the contents of literal fields in
             pairs of "delimiters".  Legal delimiters are:
             [ ], < >, { }, " ", ' ',  , ! !, | |, \ / and # #.

             If you use all the right-hand delimiters in the text of a
             literal field, Hermes will use a pair of **'s as
             delimiters.  When you create a file in a text editor, for
             use with FILE-INSERT, you should imitate the output of
             the SHOW command and use delimiters in the literal
             fields.  (Hermes won't let you input the ** delimiters
             when you use the FILE-INSERT command, however.)


             ______ ________             Quoted strings.         B.  Quoted strings.  Any string of characters, not including
             <cr> or <ctrl-Z>, enclosed in quotes, "...".

             In print and file templates, items print as they appear
             on the template line.  Fields are separated by one space,
             but quoted strings are not separated from fields or each
             other.  The reason is that quoted strings are frequently
             used to insert punctuation between fields.  A null quoted
             string, e.g.,"", between two fields inserts a null string,
             i.e., it leaves no space at all, between the fields.

             In compose templates, quoted strings are not included in
             the CDRAFT, but are displayed on the terminal.  They may
             be used to give instructions to the typist.


         C.  Template items effective only in print templates used with
             SURVEY, PRINT and LIST:

      10.1 Destinations for Printing Commands      10.1 Destinations for Printing Commands

      The printing commands, SURVEY, PRINT and LIST, allow you to type
      in a "destination" as the final portion of the command.  The
      destination is the place where the messages are printed.  It may
      be the terminal (TTY:), the line-printer (LPT:) or any file.  If
      your FILENAME-INPUT switch is set to Hermes, any file used as
      the destination of one of these commands is a draft-file, with
      the extension ".HRM".

      Similar commands are SHOW and the information commands HELP,
      NEWS, DESCRIBE, OUTLINE, EXAMPLE and DOCUMENT.

      Host computers may define other printing devices which can be
      used as destinations for these commands.  On some ISI hosts,
      PNG: is the device for the ISI-modified Penguin printer.

      10.2  Destinations for File Commands      10.2  Destinations for File Commands

      FILE, MOVE and THRUFILE are commands that require a file-name as
      the destination.  If your FILENAME-INPUT is set to Hermes, the
      destination file is a message-file, with the extension ".TXT".

      
      10.3  Current Destinations, FDESTINATION and LDESTINATION      10.3  Current Destinations, FDESTINATION and LDESTINATION

      There are only two current destinations, which are displayed in
      commands as their values, e.g., TTY: or CORMORANT.TXT, not as 
      the names of the current destinations themselves.

       LDESTINATION     Default for the LIST and DOCUMENT commands;
                        initially set to LPT: (LINE-PRINTER).  It may
                        be set to TTY: or any file.

      11.  THE ACTIVE-ENVIRONMENT      11.  THE ACTIVE-ENVIRONMENT

      The ACTIVE-ENVIRONMENT is the collection of all your user-created
      and user-settable objects, with the exception of sequences.
      (Sequences are attached to the message-file, not the individual
      user.)  The ? and <esc> are especially useful when you are
      exploring commands that have to do with objects.

      The types of objects in the ACTIVE-ENVIRONMENT are:

           o           o  user-created templates and templates

           o           o  the CFILTER

           o           o  all current templates, such as the STEMPLATE
              the USER-FIELDS object, and the field-names in it

           o           o  the SWITCHES object, and the switch settings in it

           o           o  LDESTINATION and FDESTINATION

           o           o  the PROFILE

           o           o  the RECORD-OF-MESSAGE-FILES

      If your UPDATE-PROFILE switch is set to YES, your ACTIVE-
      ENVIRONMENT is automatically copied into your PROFILE when you
      QUIT, EXIT or LOGOUT.

      11.2 The PROFILE      11.2 The PROFILE

      The PROFILE is stored in a TENEX file named ^-HERMES'-^.PROFILE;n
      (on TOPS-20, ^-HERMES'-^.PROFILE.n), where n is any number.  When
      you enter Hermes, your ACTIVE-ENVIRONMENT is automatically set to
      the ^-HERMES'-^.PROFILE file in your login directory.

      When you CONNECT to another directory, Hermes pays no attention
      to the ^-HERMES'-^.PROFILE file in the connected directory.

      
      11.2.2 PROFILE Transfer and Backup      11.2.2 PROFILE Transfer and Backup

      You can use Hermes to place your ACTIVE-ENVIRONMENT in a TENEX or
      TOPS-20 profile file.

           __     ___                ________________           EX     ACT                BIRDERS.PRFL<cr>          >EXPORT ACTIVE-ENVIRONMENT BIRDERS.PRFL<cr>

      It is a good idea to do this to make a backup of your regular
      Hermes profile.  If you want to set your ACTIVE-ENVIRONMENT to
      some other profile:

           ___ ___                _____________         ____           SET ACT                <GFINCH>BIRDE         <cr>          >SET ACTIVE-ENVIRONMENT <GFINCH>BIRDERS.PRFL.3<cr>

      When you QUIT Hermes (even though your UPDATE-PROFILE switch is
      set to YES), Hermes warns you before updating your Active-
      Environment.  To switch back to your original profile:

           ___ ___                ____           SET ACT                <cr>          >SET ACTIVE-ENVIRONMENT <cr>

      This command always defaults to the ^-HERMES'-^.PROFILE file in
      your login directory.

      
      11.2.3  The PROFILE Editor      11.2.3  The PROFILE Editor

      Usually, it is easier to change a PROFILE by first changing the
      ACTIVE-ENVIRONMENT, but there is also a PROFILE Editor that you
      can use to edit your PROFILE directly.

      Entering the PROFILE Editor at the > prompt:      Entering the PROFILE Editor at the > prompt:

      The RECORD-OF-MESSAGE-FILES a list of all the message-files you
      have ever accessed, and the date that you last looked at each
      one.  It is stored in the file {-MAILSYSTEMS'-}.PROFILE.1 (on
      TENEX, {-MAILSYSTEMS'-}.PROFILE;1), and the version number must
      be 1.

      You can enter the editor from either the > or the p-> prompt.

      EDIT RECORD-OF-MESSAGE-FILES     Enters the Editor.

      The prompt is r->, and the significant commands are DELETE and
      UNDELETE.  The DELETE command has two functions:


         a)  It marks the record of a message-file to be deleted when
             you leave the editor with DONE.  Usually it is important
             to delete records only if Hermes tells you that the 
             RECORD-OF-MESSAGE-FILES is full.


         b)  If you have deleted a message-file in your connected
             directory and left an "orphan" parseq file, you can delete
             the record of the message-file in the Record-of-Message-
             Files.  This action gets rid of the parseq file.

             For example, suppose you have deleted a message-file,
             OLDBIRDS.TXT.2, and the parseq file, ^OLDBIRDS.TXT^.2 is
             left over.

             On TENEX, you may find it easier to type:

              ____ ___                    ____              EDIT REC                    <cr>             >EDIT RECORD-OF-MESSAGE-FILES<cr>

             and then SHOW, and use the DELETE command within the
             RECORD-OF-MESSAGE-FILES editor.

             On TOPS-20, it is probably easier to type:

              ________              PUSH<cr>             >PUSH<cr>
              ___    _______________              DEL    *OLDBIRDS.*<cr>             @DELETE *OLDBIRDS.*<cr>

              PART B:  THE EDITOR INTERFACE TO THE WHOLE DRAFT              PART B:  THE EDITOR INTERFACE TO THE WHOLE DRAFT



      12.  INTRODUCTION      12.  INTRODUCTION

      In Hermes Message System, Version 4.3.1 and higher, two interface
      styles are available for editing the draft message (which is
      called the current draft or CDRAFT).

                                    ______ _____ _________      You have a choice between the command-line interface used in
                                              ______ _________      previous versions of Hermes and the new editor interface when you
      wish to COMPOSE a new draft, or to use one of the other commands
      that create or modify the current draft.

      The Editor Interface style is designed for screen-oriented
      editors, although it can be used with any auxiliary editor that
      Hermes supports.  It allows you to edit an entire draft without
      leaving the editor.

      The Hermes commands that do not directly create or modify the
      CDRAFT are not changed.  Specifically, the commands for reading
      messages and for sending the complete draft remain the same.

      The mechanism for making individual files that contain copies of
      the CDRAFT has been thoroughly revised and made uniform.  Backup
      files created by Hermes and draft files created by the STORE-
      DRAFT have a uniform format, and may be edited either in Hermes
      or at the Exec level, with any editor.


      12.1  Using the Editor Interface Style      12.1  Using the Editor Interface Style


      12.1.1  The INTERFACE-STYLE Switch      12.1.1  The INTERFACE-STYLE Switch

      There is a new switch named INTERFACE-STYLE:

       __   __     ___            ____       SH   SW     INT            <cr>      >SHOW SWITCH INTERFACE-STYLE<cr>

        INTERFACE-STYLE   [X]Ask          Editor       Command-Line

            Ask.        1.  Ask.  Default setting.

            Every time you use a command that affects the CDRAFT,
            Hermes asks whether you want to perform the command using
            the auxiliary editor of your choice (i.e., your default
            editor.  See Section 12.2).  For example, if you give the
            COMPOSE command and your default editor is EMACS, Hermes
            asks: "Compose using Emacs? (Y or N)"

                                   - 47 -      12.2                                     HERMES GUIDE -- Part B

            Command-line Interface.        2.  Command-line Interface.

            This is the old Hermes.  Commands that use templates prompt
            you one line at a time, and then place you in DRAFT-EDITOR.
            Additions or changes to the CDRAFT are made by command
            lines typed at the >> prompt.  The only difference from
            previous versions of Hermes is that at the >> prompt the
            default for the auxiliary editors has been changed.  (See
            Section 13.3, page 51.)

            Editor Interface.        3.  Editor Interface.

            You are placed in your default editor.  The editor buffer
            contains the whole draft, including both header fields and
            the Text: field.  You can use the editor commands to move
            freely from field to field without leaving the editor.

      12.1.2  Override Subcommands      12.1.2  Override Subcommands

      All of the commands that affect the CDRAFT let you use a
      subcommand to change the interface style just for the current
      command.  Enter the subcommand mode by typing ",<cr>" at the end
      of the command.

           ___    _____           COM    ,<cr>          >COMPOSE,<cr>

          To:

      12.2  The EDITOR-DEFAULT Switch      12.2  The EDITOR-DEFAULT Switch

      The whole-draft Editor Interface was designed primarily to take
      advantage of screen-oriented editors, but it works the same way
      for all editors.  The auxiliary editors are the ones available in
      the EDITOR-DEFAULT switch:

       __   __     _______       ____       SH   SW     EDITOR-       <cr>      >SHOW SWITCH EDITOR-DEFAULT<cr>

        EDITOR-DEFAULT       None         Teco         Xed
                                          We        [X]Emacs
                                          Tv

      Teco  = BBN Teco, line-oriented.
      Xed   = line-oriented editor distributed from ISI.
      WE    = BBN screen editor.
      Emacs = screen editor distributed from MIT.
      TV    = screen-oriented version of DEC Teco.

      Every time you use a command that affects the CDRAFT, Hermes in
      the Editor Interface style creates a file that contains the
      CDRAFT, starts the auxiliary text editor, and places a copy of
      the file in the editor buffer.  For example, the COMPOSE command
      results in an editor buffer that contains lines from the
      composing template used in the command.

      13.1  Commands That Place the Whole Draft in the Editor      13.1  Commands That Place the Whole Draft in the Editor

      Most of the commands that affect the CDRAFT may be typed at
      either the > or the >> prompt.

      COMPOSE      COMPOSE <template>
                      Creates the editor buffer based on the template.

      CREATE      CREATE (not at >>; defaults to CDRAFT)
                      Places current CDRAFT contents, if any, in the
                      editor buffer.  If the CDRAFT is empty, the
                      editor buffer contains only the "text divider
                      line" used to separate the header fields from the
                      Text: field.

      EDIT      EDIT (defaults to CDRAFT)
                      Places current CDRAFT contents, if any, in the
                      editor buffer.  (The default for EDIT at the >>
                      prompt has been changed from previous versions of
                      Hermes.  EDIT always defaults to the CDRAFT.)

      EXPLODE      EXPLODE <message>
                      Places a copy of the specified message in the
                      editor buffer.

      FORWARD      FORWARD <messages> <template> <include template>
                      From the specified message(s), creates the editor
                      buffer, using the first template for the header
                      fields and the second template for the messages
                      from the current message-file that are copied
                      into the Text: field.

      REPLY      REPLY <message> <template>
                      From information in the specified message, Hermes
                      creates the editor buffer, using the reply
                      template.  If the EDITOR-DEFAULT switch is set to
                      EMACS, Hermes creates a two-window screen, with
                      the editor buffer for the reply message in the
                      lower window and a copy of the replied-to message
                      in the upper window.

      RESTORE-DRAFT      RESTORE-DRAFT <file>
                      Creates the editor buffer using the specified
                      draft file, which may be a file created by:

                        1.  The STORE-DRAFT command.

                        2.  The Editor Interface backup file, the
                            WHOLEDRAFT.COPY.

                        3.  The Hermes file, $DRAFT-BACKUP...

                        4.  Any other backup file created by an
                            auxiliary editor, as a result of either a
                            "save" command, or an "autosave" feature.
                            Examples are the ;S command in Teco and TV
                            and the autosave feature in EMACS that
                            creates the file $HERMES-EMACS-BACKUP.HRM.
                            (See Section B.6, page 66.)

      The COMMENT command and <CTRL-K> continue to create editor
      buffers that contain only a single field:


      COMMENT      COMMENT <message> <field>
                      At the > prompt, COMMENT creates an editor buffer
                      for the comment field only, and places an
                      identifier line in it, based on the username and
                      a timestamp.

      COMMENT      COMMENT <field> At the >> prompt, COMMENT acts like the top-level
                      command, but creates a field in the CDRAFT.

      <ctrl-K>      <ctrl-K>        This control character, when typed inside a field
                      that is being created in command-line mode,
                      creates a editor buffer containing only the
                      single field.  Regardless of the setting of the
                      INTERFACE-STYLE switch, <CTRL-K> can be used in
                      the Hermes sense only if the Command-Line style
                      is in effect.

                          CAUTION: <CTRL-K> works only on text-type or
                          line-type  fields, e.g., Text: or Subject:.

      13.3  Forcing the Edit of a Single Field      13.3  Forcing the Edit of a Single Field

      In Hermes versions 4.2.2 and lower, the EDIT command at the >>
      prompt defaulted to the Text: field, and so did the commands for
      the auxiliary editors, EMACS, TECO, TV, WE and XED.

      In Hermes versions 4.3.3 and higher, the EDIT command defaults to
      the CDRAFT at both the > and the >> prompts, just like the SHOW
      command.

      The EDIT command, and the commands for the auxiliary editors can
      all be forced to edit a single field by specifying the field-name
      in the command.


      <editor command> <field>      <editor command> <field>

                      Starts the specified editor (or the default
                      editor for EDIT) and places the contents of the
                      field, if any, in the editor .  The buffer
                      contains plain text, without the divider line.
                      For example:

                            ____ ___    ____                            EDIT Sub    <cr>                          >>EDIT Subject<cr>

      14.1  Transforming Templates into Editor Buffers      14.1  Transforming Templates into Editor Buffers

      In the Editor Interface style, the template used with the COMPOSE
      command, for example, is displayed immediately in the Editor
      Buffer, looking like a form to be filled in.  The header fields
      are separated from the Text: field by a divider line.

      Figures 1 and 2 show templates used with the COMPOSE command and
      the corresponding Editor Buffers.

      Figure 2 illustrates several points about the Editor Buffer:

        1.  The fields are NOT all displayed in the order in which they
            appear in the template.  The "fixed" header fields are
            shown first, in a fixed order.  The "user-fields", which
            are Meeting-(date): and Meeting-place:, are shown after the
            fixed header fields, in the order in which they appear in
            the template.  The Text: field is the shown as the area
            below the divider line.

        2.  The "literal fields" in the template become fields that are
            already filled in.

        3.  Because the editor is EMACS, the last three lines of the
            screen are the EMACS mode line and echo area.



      14.2  Filling in the Form      14.2  Filling in the Form

      At this point, the whole draft is in the EMACS editor.  You are
      free to delete or add anything you choose, including field names.
      (It is good practice not to delete the divider line.)

      Hermes does not check the form of the draft until EMACS (or any
      other editor) hands the whole draft back to the Hermes program.
      See Appendix A for the list of rules that Hermes uses to
      interpret the whole draft.

      In Figure 3a, some, but not all, of the fields have been filled
      in.  The text added in the editor is shown underlined.

      This example shows the following points:

        1.  You don't have to fill in all the fields.

        2.  Text can added at any place in a field.

      -----------------------------------------------------------------

      14.3  Getting Back to Hermes from the Editor      14.3  Getting Back to Hermes from the Editor

      When you are in the editor, you can either abort the editing
      session, and return to Hermes with no change to the CDRAFT, or
      you can finish and pass the Editor Buffer back to the CDRAFT.
      The commands for performing these actions are different in the
      different editors, of course, but each editor uses identical
      command in Command-Line style and in Editor Interface style.

      In the example, when the draft is completed, the EMACS command
      C-X C-Z returns the Editor buffer to the CDRAFT.  If the switches
      are set so that Hermes asks questions at the end of a COMPOSE or
      REPLY command, these take effect at this point.  For example, if
      the original command was COMPOSE, and the COMPOSE-SEND switch is
      set to "Ask", and if the command that placed the draft in the
      Editor buffer was COMPOSE, Hermes asks "Send?" when the C-X C-Z
      command takes effect.

      You are next placed in the DRAFT-EDITOR, at the >> prompt. If the
      CDRAFT still exists, you can display it with the SHOW command.
      In Figure 3b, the draft of Figure 3a has undergone further
      changes.  The Keywords: field, which was not filled in, has been
      discarded. The "group name", Birders:, hides the list of names in
      the To: field.  You can display the entire list of Birders with
      the SHOW TYPED-FORM command at the >> prompt.

      To re-edit the draft in EMACS, you can use the EDIT command
      again.


      14.4  Using the REPLY Command      14.4  Using the REPLY Command

      The REPLY command in the Editor Interface mode constructs an
      Editor Buffer based on the template and on information from the
      replied-to message.  If the auxiliary editor can display only one
      buffer, this is the buffer displayed.

      The EMACS editor has been customized to divide the screen into
      two windows and display the reply draft in the lower window and
      the replied-to message in the upper window.  Like almost
      everything else in Hermes, this feature is under the control of a
      switch, the REPLY-VIEW switch.

      Figure 4, on page 58, shows a two-window REPLY screen, and
      Appendix Section B.2, page 64, describes this feature in detail.

      15.  DRAFTS IN INDIVIDUAL FILES -- TRANSFER, BACKUP, STORAGE      15.  DRAFTS IN INDIVIDUAL FILES -- TRANSFER, BACKUP, STORAGE

      Each file that contains a whole draft and that is created by
      either Hermes or EMACS looks just like the Editor Buffer.  The
      header fields and their contents appear first, then the line of
      hyphens separating the header fields from the text, and finally
      the Text: field itself.

      This file format is also used for the files created by the STORE-
      DRAFT command, and for the backup files named $DRAFT-BACKUP-
      <month>-<day>-<time>.HRM that are created by the Hermes backup
      facility.


      15.1  The WHOLEDRAFT.COPY File -- A Transfer Mechanism      15.1  The WHOLEDRAFT.COPY File -- A Transfer Mechanism

      Hermes uses a file named WHOLEDRAFT.COPY as the mechanism for
      passing a copy of the CDRAFT from the template to the Editor, and
      from the Editor back to the internal representation of the CDRAFT
      that is stored in Hermes.

      __ _____ _____      On TENEX hosts, the file is named WHOLEDRAFT.COPY.xx;S, where
      "xx" is the version number, determined in the normal way.

      __ _______ _____      On TOPS-20 hosts, the file is named WHOLEDRAFT.COPY.100yyy, where
      "yyy" is the number of your current job on the TOPS-20 host
      computer.

      The contents of the WHOLEDRAFT.COPY file is changed during your
      Hermes session, each time the CDRAFT is transferred from Hermes
      to the auxiliary editor or from the auxiliary editor to Hermes,
      or when the CDRAFT is sent.

      Figure 5 shows the WHOLEDRAFT.COPY for the CDRAFT of Figure 3a.

      At the Exec level, you can edit any WHOLEDRAFT.COPY or $DRAFT..
      file, or any file created by the STORE-DRAFT command with any
      editor at all.  The resulting file can be used as input to
      wholedraft editor in Hermes.  This was not true in previous
      versions of Hermes.

      In the event of a system crash or other need, you can use the
      RESTORE-DRAFT command on a WHOLEDRAFT.COPY file.

                                   - 58 -      HERMES GUIDE -- Part B                                  15.2 - 15.3.1
      -----------------------------------------------------------------

      15.2  The REPLYMSG.COPY File -- A One-Way Transfer      15.2  The REPLYMSG.COPY File -- A One-Way Transfer

          CAUTION:  This section applies only if your EDITOR-DEFAULT
          switch is set to EMACS and your REPLY-VIEW switch is set to
          UpperWindow or Ask, or you use the appropriate subcommand for
          REPLY.

      When Hermes uses the customized EMACS editor as its auxiliary
      editor, the REPLY command constructs a two-window screen, with
      the replied-to message, printed through the PTEMPLATE, in the
      upper window.  The replied-to message is in an EMACS buffer named
      *Reply-Msg*.  The reply draft itself is placed in the *Hermes*
      buffer in the lower window.  Hermes uses a file named
      REPLYMSG.COPY as the mechanism for passing a copy of the replied-
      to message, to *Reply-Msg* buffer.  This buffer is not passed
      back to Hermes, but you can access it from within EMACS with any
      of the appropriate EMACS commands.  The version number is the
      same as for the corresponding WHOLEDRAFT.COPY file.

      Even though you return from EMACS to the >> prompt and SEND the
      reply, the contents of REPLYMSG.COPY is not changed until you
      give a new REPLY command in Hermes.


      15.3  The $DRAFT-BACKUP..  and $TEXT-BACKUP.. files      15.3  The $DRAFT-BACKUP..  and $TEXT-BACKUP.. files

      These files provide a backup mechanism at the Hermes level only.


      15.3.1  The Backup for the CDRAFT      15.3.1  The Backup for the CDRAFT

      Hermes creates a file named

          $DRAFT-BACKUP-<month>-<day>-<time>.HRM

      whenever there is an unsent CDRAFT, and you are not using an
      auxiliary editor.  $DRAFT-BACKUP.. file is updated when the
      CDRAFT is passed from an editor to Hermes.  In the Hermes DRAFT-
      EDITOR, the $DRAFT-BACKUP.. file is updated every two minutes or
      so if any changes have been made by commands typed at the >>
      prompt (but not in an auxiliary editor).  When the draft is sent
      (by the SEND or REFILE command), the $DRAFT-BACKUP.. file is
      deleted.  If Hermes ends in an irregular way, the $DRAFT-BACKUP..
      file is preserved, and can be restored by the RESTORE-DRAFT
      command.

      The $DRAFT-BACKUP.. files have the same format as the
      WHOLEDRAFT.COPY files.

      -----------------------------------------------------------------

      15.3.2  The Backup for the Text: Field in Command-Line Mode      15.3.2  The Backup for the Text: Field in Command-Line Mode

      The file named

          $TEXT-BACKUP-<month>-<day>-<time>.HRM

      is created whenever you input text to the Text: field without
      using an auxiliary editor.  It is updated every two minutes if
      there have been keystrokes input during the preceding interval.
      The $TEXT-BACKUP.. file is a plain text file, and can be input
      into the CDRAFT with the APPEND-FILE command.  You will not
      create $TEXT-BACKUP.. files while you use the Editor Interface
      style.


      15.4  The Files Created by STORE-DRAFT      15.4  The Files Created by STORE-DRAFT

      The files created by the STORE-DRAFT command may have any names
      you choose, and can be restored by the RESTORE-DRAFT command.
      They have the same format as the WHOLEDRAFT.COPY files.


      15.4.1  The $HERMES-EMACS-BACKUP.HRM file      15.4.1  The $HERMES-EMACS-BACKUP.HRM file

      This file is a permanent backup file at the EMACS level only.  It
      is created when EMACS is run as an auxiliary editor under Hermes,
      either in the Editor Interface mode, where the whole draft is
      placed in the *Hermes* buffer, or in the Command-Line mode, where
      the Text: field only is placed in the *Hermes* buffer.

      If for some reason, the transfer of the editor buffer between
      EMACS and Hermes fails, this file is a backup of the work done
      during the EMACS editing session.

      When the WHOLEDRAFT.COPY file is passed from the editor back to
      Hermes, the system attempts to figure out what you intended --
      just as it does in command-line mode when you type in response to
      a Hermes prompt.  The system must also figure out where fields
      begin and end, even if you make minor mistakes.


      A.1  Rules for Field Boundaries      A.1  Rules for Field Boundaries

                           ______ ______        1.  In the CDRAFT, header fields come first, followed by
                ____            the Text: field.

                _______ ____        2.  The divider line between the header fields and the Text:
            field is a line of hyphens.  (It must begin with a hyphen
            and contain only hyphens and spaces.)  Whatever comes after
            the divider line is the Text: field, and it may contain any
            sort of text.

        3.  When the divider line is missing, Hermes sometimes puts
            some of the first paragraph of the text field into one of
            the header fields.  (Just use the EDIT command to put the
            CDRAFT into the editor and move the material from the
            header field into the text field.)  Hermes may ask you
            about its guess, or warn you about a doubtful line.


      A.2  Rules for Header Field Names      A.2  Rules for Header Field Names

                                      _____ ____      Each header field starts with a field name.  A field name is a
      string of characters that then with a colon, ":".  Hermes makes
      some guesses if the field name is missing or unrecognizable
      according to its rules.

      When Hermes needs help, it enters into a dialog with you.

      Some sample dialogs follow, in which Hermes' questions are shown
      in quotation marks, with the specific text from the Editor Buffer
      indicated by <field-name>, <field-contents> or <line>.  The
      human's answers are underlined.  (A "known field" is either a
      standard field, such as To: or Subject:, or a user-field
      currently in the User-Fields list in the Active-Environment.)

            CAUTION: These dialogs are not in final form.
            They may be different in your version of Hermes.

      A.3  Rules for Correcting Errors in Addressees and Hosts      A.3  Rules for Correcting Errors in Addressees and Hosts

      Hermes checks the addressees and hosts.  If any problems occur,
      you are queried:

      Not a local user: Wobbler
                                    _______                                    Warbler      Replace with [CR means none]: Warbler

      You can either replace the invalid name with a new one or tell
      Hermes to throw away that addressee.  Hermes places the
      addressees in the current draft as they are checked.


               CAUTION: Do not use <CTRL-E> during this
               dialog. <CTRL-E> results in the loss of the
               changes made in the Editor Buffer.

      feature, and you will acquire some new files in your login
      directory.


        o        o  If you indicate that you want to use the NOVICE feature by
           answering YES, EMACS creates an EMACS.PROFILE file.

      B.1  The *Hermes* Buffer      B.1  The *Hermes* Buffer

      Emacs is a multi-buffer editor, hence Hermes and Emacs must agree
      on a specific buffer to hold the Emacs copy of the CDRAFT.  This
      is given the special name, *Hermes*.

                CAUTION: Do not change the buffer name,
                *Hermes*.  If you do, the result of the edit
                will not be passed properly from the Editor
                Buffer to Hermes.  Also, do not write out the
                contents of the *Hermes* buffer.


      The *Hermes* buffer does not have to be your current buffer  when
      you quit Emacs with C-X C-Z, but it must still be in existence.
      The *Hermes* buffer is the only Emacs buffer whose contents is
      transferred to Hermes.  If you have killed the *Hermes* buffer,
      Emacs returns to Hermes cleanly, and the CDRAFT remains unchanged.

      Figure 4, on page 58, shows the two-window screen for the REPLY
      command.  The Mode line contains the name of the *Hermes* buffer
      because that is the current buffer.



      B.2.1  The *Reply-Msg* Buffer          B.2.1  The *Reply-Msg* Buffer

      When you use the REPLY command, with the REPLY-VIEW switch set to
      it initial setting, UpperWindow, Hermes constructs a file named
      REPLYMSG.COPY which contains a copy of the replied-to message,
      printed through the PTEMPLATE.  Emacs places the contents of
      REPLYMSG.COPY file in the *Reply-Msg* buffer, and displays the
      *Reply-Msg* buffer in the upper window of the screen.

      From this point on, the *Reply-Msg* buffer is treated just like
      any other Emacs buffer.  You can move the cursor to the reply
      window, copy text from the *Reply-Msg* buffer to the *Hermes*
      buffer, write the *Reply-Msg* buffer out to a file, or kill the
      *Reply-Msg* buffer completely.

      B.3  M-X Insert File <file> = Hermes <CTRL-B>      B.3  M-X Insert File <file> = Hermes <CTRL-B>

      In the Command-Line Style, it is possible to input the contents
      of a file into a field while you are "inside" the field by using
      the Hermes command <CTRL-B>.

      The equivalent command within Emacs is

          M-X Insert File$<file-name> <cr>

      This command inserts the contents of a file at the current point
      in the Emacs buffer.

      Material can also be transferred from another Emacs buffer to the
      draft in the *Hermes* buffer.  For example, you can create a new
      buffer containing a file with the command C-X C-F, edit the
      contents of that buffer, and then insert the buffer into the
      *Hermes* buffer with the command

          M-X Insert Buffer$<buffer-name><cr>



      B.4  M-X Hermes Abort      B.4  M-X Hermes Abort

      To abort an edit in Emacs and leave the CDRAFT exactly as it was
      before the Hermes command that invoked Emacs, use the command

          M-X Hermes Abort<cr>

      The normal Emacs abort, C-C, is not recommended.



      B.5  Successive Draft Editing      B.5  Successive Draft Editing

      When you return to the DRAFT-EDITOR, at the >> prompt, Hermes
      keeps the Emacs editor process that it created to handle the
      draft.  The next time you use a command that needs the editor,
      Hermes starts the existing fork, giving it a new WHOLEDRAFT.COPY
      file from which Emacs creates a new *Hermes* buffer.  In all
      other respects, Emacs is unchanged from when you previously ran
      it.  Any customizing or extra buffers that you created are still
      there.

      The only time that Hermes discards the Emacs process is when
      Emacs terminates with an error code that Hermes does not
      recognize.  This can happen if you terminate Emacs with C-C, but
      not when you use M-X Hermes Abort.

      The Hermes DRAFT-EDITOR autosaving feature, which creates the
      $DRAFT-BACKUP.. file, is not available when you are in Emacs. For
      this reason, Emacs running under Hermes specifies the Emacs
      autosaving feature, and autosaves the *Hermes* buffer into a file
      named $HERMES-EMACS-BACKUP.HRM.

      When you use the Editor Interface style, the $HERMES-EMACS-
      BACKUP.HRM file has the same format as the other Hermes backup
      files, and can be restored by the Hermes RESTORE-DRAFT command.

      When EMACS is called in a lower fork under Hermes, EMACS
      automatically loads the Hermes library.  The Hermes library, in
      turn, loads Novice library.  EMACS then looks for a file named
      EMACS.PROFILE in the login directory.  If none exists, EMACS asks
      the following question:


      Help (in the form of a NOVICE facility) is available for people      Help (in the form of a NOVICE facility) is available for people
      learning EMACS.  NOVICE starts you with a small subset of EMACS      learning EMACS.  NOVICE starts you with a small subset of EMACS

        o        o  If you answer YES, EMACS creates an EMACS.PROFILE file which
           turns off the less frequently used EMACS commands, and
           installs a special HELP feature.

        o        o  If you answer NO, EMACS looks for a EMACS.VARS file, creates
           one if necessary, and inserts a line in the file that
           ensures that you are not asked the question again.

      As you use EMACS, you normally type some of the disabled
      commands, either by accident or on purpose.  When you do, EMACS

      gives you a menu of choices.

      The NOVICE feature has a two-layered HELP function.

      When you hit the HELP key the first time, EMACS places you in the
      HELP buffer and displays some general instructions, followed by a
      list of the keys currently turned ON.  These will vary for each
      user, and the initial list may be changed from time to time.

      You can hit the HELP key a second time, while you are in the
      first HELP buffer, and use a second layer of HELP.  This layer
      allows you to get descriptions of EMACS functions, and the
      corresponding commands, and also to search for EMACS functions
      that contain a word you supply as part of the function name.

      The output of the second layer of help is "ephemeral", i.e., it
      is displayed on the terminal but is not placed in a buffer.  The
      second layer of help appears when you hit the HELP key while you
      are in the HELP buffer, as a result of hitting the HELP key the
      first time.  The second layer of help offers you a menu of five
      commands: A, C, D, Q or ?

      C  Says what a certain command (character) does. You type the      C  Says what a certain command (character) does. You type the

      Q or C-G returns you to the buffer you were editing when you
      asked for help.

      The help buffer does not disappear.  It shrinks but part of it
      stays on the screen so you can refer to its contents.  Normally,
      it shrinks to half of its original size.  You can control how
      many lines remain on the screen by editing the option "Help
      Window Visible".  (See Section 22.3 [Variables], in the EMACS
      MANUAL.)  You could also predefine a different value for this
      variable by setting it in the EMACS.VARS file in your login
      directory.  (See Section C.6.)


      C.6  The EMACS.VARS File      C.6  The EMACS.VARS File

      You can customize EMACS through the use of either of two files in
      your login directory.  If you are an expert at EMACS, you can
      create a file named EMACS.INIT, which contains Teco code, and
      which should end by calling the EMACS.INIT file in the EMACS
      directory.

      If you are not an EMACS expert, you can do simple customization
      by editing an EMACS.VARS in your login directory.

      To understand the following explanation, refer to Chapter 22
      [Simple Customization], in the EMACS MANUAL.

      As mentioned at the beginning of this Appendix, if you accept the
      NOVICE facility, EMACS creates an EMACS.PROFILE file, but if you
      do NOT accept NOVICE, EMACS creates an EMACS.VARS file for you,
      in your login directory.




                                   - 70 -      HERMES GUIDE -- Appendix C                                  C.6.1
      -----------------------------------------------------------------

      The contents of the EMACS.VARS file that rejects NOVICE is:

           VARS file that does not load NOVICE.           VARS file that does not load NOVICE.
      Novice Status:0      Novice Status:0

          NOTE:  Comment lines in VARS files begin with "white-space";
          in this case, we use a tab, but a space would work just as
          well.

      The reason for creating the EMACS.VARS file is tht Hermes loads
      two EMACS libraries automatically:  a word-processing library and
      the NOVICE library.  The EMACS.VARS file is required to overrule
      the NOVICE library that has been loaded previously.

      However, you can, if you wish, use an EMACS.VARS file to carry
      over the word-processing and NOVICE libraries to EMACS even when
      you are not using Hermes.  The file MINIMAL-EMACS.VARS in the
      EMACS directory on your host computer contains Teco commands for
      automatically loading the word processing library and the NOVICE
      library.

      The <EMACS>MINIMAL-EMACS.VARS file:

      C.6.1  A Customized EMACS.VARS File      C.6.1  A Customized EMACS.VARS File

      This section shows an EMACS.VARS file which is customized for
      Hermes users; it loads libraries for NOVICE and word processing
      (WPLIB), and also contains some improvements for EMACS used as a
      stand-alone system.

        o        o  The first three commands in this VARS file improve the
           Autosave functions for EMACS when it is used as a stand-
           alone editor,

        o        o  The next two commands change the EMACS "key bindings" so
           that <ctrl-W> works the same way in both Hermes and EMACS.
           The function "Kill Region" (which is <ctrl-W> or C-W in the
           default EMACS) is placed on the <meta-RUBOUT> key.  Chapter
           22 of the EMACS MANUAL explains that the first ^R displayed
           in each command is <ctrl-R> and the second is a combination
           of the caret character, "^" and the capital R. The function
           displayed as "^?" is the RUBOUT character.

        o        o  Just for fun, the VARS file replaces the ============ window
           divider with a classical egg-and-dart border pattern.

      D.1  Troubleshooting Routine      D.1  Troubleshooting Routine


        1.  Hermes fails for one user only.

              a.  Run Hermes without a message-file, using the commands
                  that override the input of the Inbox file.

                       ___________                     ____                       Hermes<esc>                     <cr>                      @Hermes<esc> (using message-file)<cr>     (TENEX)

                       ___________                       Hermes,<cr>                      @Hermes,<cr>                            (TOPS-20)
                                          ____                                          <cr>                      (using message-file)<cr>

                  If Hermes runs correctly without a message-file,
                  the problem is probably a serious defect in the 
                  Inbox file, which is named MESSAGE.TXT;1 on TENEX
                  and MAIL.TXT.1 on TOPS-20, or its companion 
                  "parseq" file, ^MESSAGE.TXT^;1 or ^MAIL.TXT^.1.

              b.  If Hermes does not run correctly without a
                  message-file, the problem is probably in the file 
                  {-MAILSYSTEMS'-}.PROFILE.1.

        2.  Hermes fails for all users.

            Check the protection of all files and directories
            associated with Hermes, including any pointer files.
            If these are correct, try re-initializing Hermes.

      Refer to the following sections for more information about fixing
      these problems.

      D.2.1  Archived Files      D.2.1  Archived Files                         

      Hermes will not work correctly on TOPS-20 if either of the
      following files have been "archived" or "migrated" and have left
      behind a filename with zero contents.  Each of these files must
      always have a version number of "1".

      D.2.2  The Hermes Profile File      D.2.2  The Hermes Profile File

      If Hermes has trouble accessing a Hermes profile file, which is
                                n        n      named ^-HERMES'-^.PROFILE.n (where n is any number), it simply
      constructs a new profile with a new version number.  This is
      significant for the system maintainer.  If a user complains that
      his or her individual switch settings and user-created templates
      have suddenly disappeared, you should check the directory to see
      whether there is a new version of the Hermes profile file.  The
      old one may be intact, or it may have been archived or injured in
      a system crash.  (See Section 11.2, in Part A, for instructions
      about creating backup files for Hermes profiles.)

      FIX-HERMES removes the "parse" portion of the "parseq" file,
      which is a "companion file" for your message-file.  The "parse"
      contains information about the location of the messages and their
      individual fields.  This information is constantly updated by
      Hermes, and may become deranged if the parseq file is open when
      the host computer crashes or a Hermes session ends with <CTRL-C>.

      After you run FIX-HERMES, and then enter Hermes again, the parse
      must be reconstructed.  The parse information is kept in a
      separate file to protect the messages in the message-file. Hermes
      automatically constructs a parseq file for each message-file, and
      names it to correspond to the message-file.  For example, the
      message-file named MAIL.TXT.1 has a parseq file named
      ^MAIL.TXT^.1.  FIX-HERMES requires you to type ONLY the message-
      file name, i.e., MAIL.TXT.

      -----------------------------------------------------------------

      The FIX-HERMES instructions do not appear if there is no current
      message-file (CMESSAGE-FILE).  The fact that the FIX-HERMES
      instructions do appear does NOT mean that the error is actually
      in the "parse" portion of the parseq file, or even in the parse
      file at all.

      Nevertheless, FIX-HERMES has proved to fix a large majority of
      errors currently reported by Hermes users.


      D.2.4  How Hermes Corrects Character Counts in Messages      D.2.4  How Hermes Corrects Character Counts in Messages

      Hermes includes a "fixer" that can repair most "broken" message-
      files.  Message-files are "broken" when the character-counts of
      one or more messages do not match the actual length of the
      message.

      The "fixer" is controlled by a Hermes switch:

        FIX-BROKEN-FILE   [X]Ask          Yes          No

      The character-count is stored in the machine-readable header that
      (a) precedes every message in a message-file, and (b) is never
      printed by Hermes, although you can see it if you place a
      message-file in an ordinary text editor.

      Example:      Example:

      11-Jun-1982 12:43:28,863;000000000001
      Mail-from: BBN ...

      In this machine-readable header, the character-count is 863,
      which means that the number of characters between the beginning
                  _____      of the line after the machine-readable header and the end
      of the message is 863.

      The most frequent cause of an unexpected broken message is a
      network or system crash or similar disaster.  Such crashes may
      insert a block of ASCII nulls in the message-file, usually one or
      more computer "pages" in length.  Message-files may also be
      broken because someone has edited the file with a text editor,
      and changed the length of a message.

      Be sure to check the message that was reported not to "parse".
      There may be some text missing, or two messages may be combined.

      D.2.5  How to Recover from Disk Errors      D.2.5  How to Recover from Disk Errors

      If you get an error that indicates the message-file on the disk
      is damaged, the best thing to do is to try to copy the file,
      using one or another of the commands or programs available on the
      system.


        o  The COPY command on TENEX or TOPS-20.        o  The COPY command on TENEX or TOPS-20.


        o  The TECO editor.        o  The TECO editor.

           BBN Teco has a "switch" that lets it accept "binary" files,
           i.e., files containing 36-bit "computer words" with bit 35
           set to 1.  Normal ASCII files do not contain such computer
           words, but damaged files may have "garbage" that includes
           some computer words with bit 35 set.

           Before you input the file, give the command

           *^B1$

           where "^" is the ASCII character "^", named "caret" or
           "uparrow".

           Test to see that the switch is set with

           *^B=$

           Teco returns -1 if the switch is set or 0 if it is not.


        o  The BEDIT editor.        o  The BEDIT editor.

           BEDIT is a binary editor, intended for editing program files
           rather than text.  It has one important virtue:  Unlike most
           editors, BEDIT does NOT copy the file into a buffer before
           it lets you begin to edit.  Instead, BEDIT places pointers
           to positions in the file, and does not actually copy any
           portion of the file until you give it a command.  Thus, if a
           portion of the file cannot be copied, you can still use
           BEDIT to copy the rest of the file, before and after the bad
           portion.  If you cannot pass the entire file through BEDIT,
           you can still use BEDIT to carve the file into sections and
           rescue the sections that are still good.

           BEDIT is a simple program, with adequate documentation if
           you type ? to the > prompt.  Note that the byte size is 7
           for message-files (ASCII text).

           Use ^E (instead of rubout) to return to command level.

           C: Copy from input file to output

           V: Verbose typeouts
           N: Nonverbose
           Q: Quit, closing files

      Passing the file through COPY, or into and out of one of the
      editors usually puts the file into a state where Hermes will
      accept it as input.  You may find that the message contains a
      section of ASCII nulls, which show up as "@"s in BEDIT or in Teco
      with the ^B switch set.  These are thrown away when the file is
      output from Teco.


      D.2.6  PARSEQ files      D.2.6  PARSEQ files

      The "parseq" files, such as ^MAIL.TXT^.1, must each have the same
      version number as the corresponding message-file.  However,
      Hermes is prepared to handle ";OFFLINE" parseq files.  Hermes
      renames an archived parseq file to another distinctive name tied
      to the name and version number of the message-file.

      For example, if the message-file BIRDERS.TXT.3 exists on disk,
      but the corresponding parseq file is archived:

      ^BIRDERS.TXT^.3;OFFLINE ==> BIRDERS.ARCHIVED-PARSEQ.3;OFFLINE

      Hermes then constructs a new parseq file, with the name

           ^BIRDERS.TXT^.3


      D.3  Problems with Files in the HERMES Directory      D.3  Problems with Files in the HERMES Directory

      If the file, <SUBSYS>HERMES.EXE (or <SUBSYS>HERMES.SAV) is a
      small "pointer" file that transfers control to the actual file,
      such as <HERMES>HERMES.EXE, you must make sure that the file
      protection of the files in the <HERMES> directory is set


                                   - 77 -      D.4                                    HERMES GUIDE -- Appendix D
      -----------------------------------------------------------------

      correctly.  The following files should have their protection set
      to 775252:

          HERMES.EXE
          $HERMES.HLPSTR-0000      (where 0000 stands for the Hermes
          $HERMES.DESSTR-0000      version number, e.g., 4304 = 4.3.4)
          FIX-HERMES.EXE

      The problem is the same for the corresponding files on TENEX.

      If your host computer is a TOPS-20 with an automatic "archive" or
      "migration" feature that leaves ";OFFLINE" filenames with 0
      contents in the directory, you must also protect these files
      against being automatically "archived" or "migrated".  This is
      especially true of the FIX-HERMES.EXE file, which may be used
      very infrequently.


      D.4  When Hermes Must be Re-Initialized      D.4  When Hermes Must be Re-Initialized

      Hermes must be re-initialized under the following conditions:

        1.  Hermes is to be installed on a new host computer.

        2.  The HERMES.EXE or HERMES.SAV file has been injured in a
            system crash, so that it no longer runs, and you have no
            backup copy of Hermes that was initialized on the same
            host.

        3.  On TENEX hosts, some directory numbers have been assigned
            to new usernames.

        4.  On TENEX hosts, a new table of host numbers has been
            installed on the host computer.
