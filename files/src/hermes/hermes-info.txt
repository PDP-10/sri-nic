Yes, the NOVICE library is available.  I believe that the copy in
MIT-XX:<EMACS> is up to date (but I'll check if the net
connection is available).  You need NOVICE and a companion file:
NOVICE.EMACS
NOVICE.:EJ
MINIMAL.PROFILE

Another file, MINIMAL-EMACS.VARS, contains a mechanism for
automatically loading NOVICE into a user's environment.  It saves
having to explain Load Library to beginners (if you don't want to
put the load into the site INIT file).

NOVICE will collect data on use patterns.  This might be of some
interest to you.  It is of GREAT interest to me so if you are
willing to have the files exist, you can contribute to the
Advance of Science.  Simply create @i[empty] files by the
following name in the <emacs> directory.
NOVICE-USERS.LIST
NOVICE-USERS.DATA

The list is simply to associate names with numeric codes.  It
saves some processing time to have the file exist even if you
never enable the data collection.  The data file collects one
data word each time a person uses a help command or a command
that has been disabled.  It does NOT collect anything about the
user's application or contents of the file they are editing.

As for documentation, I haven't had time to redo the INFO file
for NOVICE.  I recommend looking over the comment at the
beginning of the source file as a way of seeing what the library
is and how it works.

Dear Friends,
		
We are starting a new method of distributing Hermes to host
computers on the ARPANET.  We have set up two new directories on
the BBNA host: <HERMES.T20> holds files for TOPS-20 hosts, and
<HERMES.10X>has files for TENEX hosts.

The directory for the TOPS-20 files is:
	
   PS:<HERMES.T20>
   .HLPSTR.1
   .INIT-T20-4403.1
   .SETUP-T20-4403.1
   .SYSG-T20-4403.1
 FIX-HERMES.EXE.1
 HDIR.HRM.2,3
 HERMES.:EJ.72
   .EMACS.72
 HERMES-GUIDE.DOC.1
 HERMES-INIT-MAINT.DOC.1
 HERMES-INFO.TXT.1
 MINIMAL.PROFILE.1
 MINIMAL-EMACS.VARS.1
 NEWTV.EXE.1
 NOVICE.:EJ.135
   .EMACS.135
   .TAGS.9
 ^HERMES-INFO.TXT^.1

 Total of 20 files
		
You can FTP files from either directory with the password BBN.

Please note that ISI, ECL and UTEXAS-20 hosts already have copies
of Hermes 4.4.3, and that $HERMES.DESSTR-4306, NEWTV.EXE and
FIX-HERMES.EXE have not changed since the Hermes 4.3.6
distribution.

The files in <HERMES.10X> are identical except that the INIT and
SYSG files are converted for use on TENEX systems and have "10X"
in their files names in place of "T20".

The file HERMES-INFO.TXT is a message-file which contains this
message and a message from Jan Walker, who implemented the NOVICE
feature.  Other messages will be placed in HERMES-INFO.TXT from
time to time.

General information about Hermes 4.4.3, including some
installation instructions, is in the NEWS section of
$HERMES.HLPSTR.  The next best information is in the two DOC
files, which are on-line copies of the printed manuals, THE
HERMES GUIDE and INITIALIZATION AND MAINTENANCE GUIDE FOR THE
HERMES MESSAGE SYSTEM.  These are available from the Hermes group
at BBN.

The DESCRIBE file, $HERMES.DESSTR-4306, is out of date, as its
version code suggests.  I hope to update it in the near future.

The HLPSTR file supplements the information about initializing
Hermes that is in HERMES-INIT-MAINT.DOC.  The big new feature is
that Hermes supports XMAILR and XMAILBOX, and has the ability to
handle (and ignore) the ".ARPA" domain.

The EMACS-related files HERMES (.:EJ.72 and .EMACS.72) and NOVICE
(.:EJ.135 and .EMACS.135) are the latest are the latest versions;
not all sites have them.  MINIMAL.PROFILE and MINIMAL-EMACS.VARS
are also part of the package, and are explained in Appendix C of
THE HERMES GUIDE.

The next version of Hermes will have a number of new features
that will (a) bring Hermes into conformity with the most
frequently encountered features of RFC 822 and (b) provide some
things that users have asked for:

  a) Hermes will go back to the old/new convention of "@" instead
of " at " in addresses.  (I will include a form letter to explain
things to what I am sure will be indignant users.)  Hermes will
start generating the ".ARPA" domain as soon as the new official
guidelines are available.

  b) Hermes will mark messages ANSWERED automatically, and will
be compatible with MM for the ANSWER and REMIND (FLAG) bits.
There will be a new switch that lets the user include the
replied-to message in the reply message, at the beginning of the
text field, and indented by 4 spaces.  Also, the TOPS-20 Hermes
will interpret logical names dynamically.

Please send a message to HERMES@BBNA when you get a system set
up, and of course let us know about any problems or suggestions.

Dear Friends,

This is the second time that we have distributed a new version of
Hermes by making it available to all comers in two special
directories on BBNA.

        <HERMES.T20> holds files for TOPS-20 hosts.
	<HERMES.10X> holds files for TENEX hosts.

The new version of Hermes is 4.4.6.  The files that are new for
this distribution are:

	$HERMES.HLPSTR-4406		$HERMES.HLPSTR-4406
	   .INIT-T20-4406		   .INIT-10X-4406
	   .SETUP-T20-4406		   .SETUP-10X-4406
	   .SYSG-T20-4406		   .SYSG-10X-4406
	HERMES-INFO.TXT			HERMES-INFO.TXT

You can FTP files from either directory with the password BBN.

Information about Hermes 4.4.6 is in the NEWS section of
$HERMES.HLPSTR.  The next best information is in the two DOC
files, which are on-line copies of the printed manuals, THE
HERMES GUIDE and INITIALIZATION AND MAINTENANCE GUIDE FOR THE
HERMES MESSAGE SYSTEM.  Printed copies of these manuals may be
purchased from the Hermes group at BBN.  Send a message to
HERMES@BBNA.

The DESCRIBE file, $HERMES.DESSTR-4306, is out of date, as its
version code suggests.  I hope to update it in the near future.

The HLPSTR file supplements the information about initializing
Hermes that is in HERMES-INIT-MAINT.DOC.  The big new features
are that Hermes 4.4.6 conforms to RFC 822, and handles MMAILER.
Other new features are explained in the NEWS.

The file HERMES-INFO.TXT contains a copy of a message about
EMACS, and the distribution messages for Hermes 4.4.3 and 4.4.6.

We plan another release of Hermes in the near future to complete
the program of compatibility with the MM system.  See the NEWS
for details.

For system installers:
 
The initialization program still defaults the "mailer-
form" to the old NCP MAILER program.  You should give
the command "XMailer-form" or "MMailer-form", according
to the version of the TCP-compatible mailer that you
plan to use.  The chief difference between XMailer and
the newer MMailer is that XMailer creates queued files
named [--NETWORK-MAIL--]..1 and MMailer creates queued
files named [--QUEUED-MAIL--].NEW-0000000000000.1.  The
numbers in the "NEW-" extension are different for each
message.  The mailer program may substitute a different
extension in the course of its operation.
 
You should also give the command "ADDRESS-CHECK", which
causes address checking by XMailbox, since the initial-
ization program still defaults to the old MAILBOX
program.

Dear Friends,

RFC897 "Domain Name System Implementation Schedule" sets March
14, 1984, as the date when all hosts should start using their
domain style names as their official and primary names.

Please make sure that you install the latest version of HERMES,
4.4.7, before March 14.  This version handles domain style names
correctly, and accepts arbitrary domain names.

Other features of HERMES 4.4.7 are:

     *  Transition to RFC822 completed; field name changes.
     *  New Deferred-Send command.
     *  Eliminate-Duplicates command.
     *  MMailr allows fast pickup of queued messages.
     *  HERMES message-files now compatible with MM.

The distribution is available on the ARPANET host BBNA, in two
special directories:

        <HERMES.T20> -- files for TOPS-20 hosts.
        <HERMES.10X> -- files for TENEX hosts.

The files for HERMES 4.4.7 are:

        $HERMES.DESSTR-4407             $HERMES.DESSTR-4407
           .HLPSTR-4407                    .HLPSTR-4407
           .INIT-T20-4407                  .INIT-10X-4407
           .SETUP-T20-4407                 .SETUP-10X-4407
           .SYSG-T20-4407                  .SYSG-10X-4407

The most recent information is in the NEWS section of
$HERMES.HLPSTR.  This is the information printed in response to
the HERMES NEWS command.  Other information files in both
directories are:

        HERMES-INFO.TXT         Messages about HERMES initializa-
                                tion and EMACS.
        HERMES-GUIDE.DOC        On-line copy of Aug 82 manual.
        HERMES-INIT-MAINT.DOC   On-line copy of Aug 82 manual for
                                initialization and maintenance.

If you have any questions, please call me at 617/497-3654 (BBN)
or 617/354-3514 (home), at any reasonable hour.  I realize that
not all HERMES sites have installed 4.4.7 and time is short.
