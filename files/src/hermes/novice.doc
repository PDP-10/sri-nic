Yes, the NOVICE library is available.  I believe that the copy in
MIT-XX:<EMACS> is up to date (but I'll check if the net
connection is available).  You need NOVICE and a companion file:
NOVICE.EMACS
NOVICE.:EJ
MINIMAL.PROFILE

Another file, MINIMAL-EMACS.VARS, contains a mechanism for
automatically loading NOVICE into a user's environment.  It saves
having to explain Load Library to beginners (if you don't want to
put the load into the site INIT file).

NOVICE will collect data on use patterns.  This might be of some
interest to you.  It is of GREAT interest to me so if you are
willing to have the files exist, you can contribute to the
Advance of Science.  Simply create @i[empty] files by the
following name in the <emacs> directory.
NOVICE-USERS.LIST
NOVICE-USERS.DATA

The list is simply to associate names with numeric codes.  It
saves some processing time to have the file exist even if you
never enable the data collection.  The data file collects one
data word each time a person uses a help command or a command
that has been disabled.  It does NOT collect anything about the
user's application or contents of the file they are editing.

As for documentation, I haven't had time to redo the INFO file
for NOVICE.  I recommend looking over the comment at the
beginning of the source file as a way of seeing what the library
is and how it works.
