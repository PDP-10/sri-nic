Dear Friends,
		
We are starting a new method of distributing Hermes to host
computers on the ARPANET.  We have set up two new directories on
the BBNA host: <HERMES.T20> holds files for TOPS-20 hosts, and
<HERMES.10X>has files for TENEX hosts.

The directory for the TOPS-20 files is:
	
   PS:<HERMES.T20>
   .HLPSTR.1
   .INIT-T20-4403.1
   .SETUP-T20-4403.1
   .SYSG-T20-4403.1
 FIX-HERMES.EXE.1
 HDIR.HRM.2,3
 HERMES.:EJ.72
   .EMACS.72
 HERMES-GUIDE.DOC.1
 HERMES-INIT-MAINT.DOC.1
 HERMES-INFO.TXT.1
 MINIMAL.PROFILE.1
 MINIMAL-EMACS.VARS.1
 NEWTV.EXE.1
 NOVICE.:EJ.135
   .EMACS.135
   .TAGS.9
 ^HERMES-INFO.TXT^.1

 Total of 20 files
		
You can FTP files from either directory with the password BBN.

Please note that ISI, ECL and UTEXAS-20 hosts already have copies
of Hermes 4.4.3, and that $HERMES.DESSTR-4306, NEWTV.EXE and
FIX-HERMES.EXE have not changed since the Hermes 4.3.6
distribution.

The files in <HERMES.10X> are identical except that the INIT and
SYSG files are converted for use on TENEX systems and have "10X"
in their files names in place of "T20".

The file HERMES-INFO.TXT is a message-file which contains this
message and a message from Jan Walker, who implemented the NOVICE
feature.  Other messages will be placed in HERMES-INFO.TXT from
time to time.

General information about Hermes 4.4.3, including some
installation instructions, is in the NEWS section of
$HERMES.HLPSTR.  The next best information is in the two DOC
files, which are on-line copies of the printed manuals, THE
HERMES GUIDE and INITIALIZATION AND MAINTENANCE GUIDE FOR THE
HERMES MESSAGE SYSTEM.  These are available from the Hermes group
at BBN.

The DESCRIBE file, $HERMES.DESSTR-4306, is out of date, as its
version code suggests.  I hope to update it in the near future.

The HLPSTR file supplements the information about initializing
Hermes that is in HERMES-INIT-MAINT.DOC.  The big new feature is
that Hermes supports XMAILR and XMAILBOX, and has the ability to
handle (and ignore) the ".ARPA" domain.

The EMACS-related files HERMES (.:EJ.72 and .EMACS.72) and NOVICE
(.:EJ.135 and .EMACS.135) are the latest are the latest versions;
not all sites have them.  MINIMAL.PROFILE and MINIMAL-EMACS.VARS
are also part of the package, and are explained in Appendix C of
THE HERMES GUIDE.

The next version of Hermes will have a number of new features
that will (a) bring Hermes into conformity with the most
frequently encountered features of RFC 822 and (b) provide some
things that users have asked for:

  a) Hermes will go back to the old/new convention of "@" instead
of " at " in addresses.  (I will include a form letter to explain
things to what I am sure will be indignant users.)  Hermes will
start generating the ".ARPA" domain as soon as the new official
guidelines are available.

  b) Hermes will mark messages ANSWERED automatically, and will
be compatible with MM for the ANSWER and REMIND (FLAG) bits.
There will be a new switch that lets the user include the
replied-to message in the reply message, at the beginning of the
text field, and indented by 4 spaces.  Also, the TOPS-20 Hermes
will interpret logical names dynamically.

Please send a message to HERMES@BBNA when you get a system set
up, and of course let us know about any problems or suggestions.

Dear Friends,

This is the second time that we have distributed a new version of
Hermes by making it available to all comers in two special
directories on BBNA.

        <HERMES.T20> holds files for TOPS-20 hosts.
	<HERMES.10X> holds files for TENEX hosts.

The new version of Hermes is 4.4.6.  The files that are new for
this distribution are:

	$HERMES.HLPSTR-4406		$HERMES.HLPSTR-4406
	   .INIT-T20-4406		   .INIT-10X-4406
	   .SETUP-T20-4406		   .SETUP-10X-4406
	   .SYSG-T20-4406		   .SYSG-10X-4406
	HERMES-INFO.TXT			HERMES-INFO.TXT

You can FTP files from either directory with the password BBN.

Information about Hermes 4.4.6 is in the NEWS section of
$HERMES.HLPSTR.  The next best information is in the two DOC
files, which are on-line copies of the printed manuals, THE
HERMES GUIDE and INITIALIZATION AND MAINTENANCE GUIDE FOR THE
HERMES MESSAGE SYSTEM.  Printed copies of these manuals may be
purchased from the Hermes group at BBN.  Send a message to
HERMES@BBNA.

The DESCRIBE file, $HERMES.DESSTR-4306, is out of date, as its
version code suggests.  I hope to update it in the near future.

The HLPSTR file supplements the information about initializing
Hermes that is in HERMES-INIT-MAINT.DOC.  The big new features
are that Hermes 4.4.6 conforms to RFC 822, and handles MMAILER.
Other new features are explained in the NEWS.

The file HERMES-INFO.TXT contains a copy of a message about
EMACS, and the distribution messages for Hermes 4.4.3 and 4.4.6.

We plan another release of Hermes in the near future to complete
the program of compatibility with the MM system.  See the NEWS
for details.

The next version of Hermes, version 4.4.7, will contain three
important changes:


    1.  The standard fields in Hermes will be brought into
        agreement with RFC822.

        A.  The following fields will be combined/renamed:
	
              NAME                  NEW NAME      DATATYPE
            Received-Date       --> Received:       line
            Mail-From:          --> Received:        "
            Redistributed-By:   --> ReSent-From:    addr
            Redistributed-To:   --> ReSent-To:      addr
            Redistributed-Date: --> ReSent-Date:    date
            [Text]:             --> Comments:       text
	
        B.  The following fields will be added as standard
            fields but the "ReSent" fields will not be
            implemented immediately as functional fields in
            the Hermes ReSend/Redistribute command.  We would
            like feedback from users as to how useful the
            extra ReSent fields would be to them.  The
            "Encrypted" field would be a purely optional
            field.  The "Return-Path" field would normally be
            filled in by the mail delivery system.
	
              NAME            DATATYPE
            Encrypted:          line
            Return-Path:        line
            ReSent-Sender:      addr
            ReSent-cc:          addr
            ReSent-bcc:         addr
            ReSent-Reply-To:    addr
            ReSent-Message-ID:  line
	
        C.  For technical reasons, we would like to get rid
            of the following standard fields that are seldom
            used.
	
              NAME            DATATYPE
            Action:             addr
            Info:               addr
            Assigned-By:        addr
            Precedence:         line
            Message-Class:      line
            Special-Handling:   line
            Class-Char:         line
            Start-Date:         date
            Suspense-Date:      date
            End-Date:           date
	
         .  If anyone has applications involving these
            fields, please let me know.  We can create
            user-fields which will be exactly the same in
            function, and almost the same in name, with the
            following exceptions:
	
            Action:             --> Action-(Addr)
            Info:               --> Info-(Addr):
            Assigned-By:        --> Assigned-By-(Addr):
            Start-Date          --> Start-(Date):
            Suspense-Date:      --> Suspense-(Date):
            End-Date:           --> End-(Date):
	
         .  I will be glad to supply a TV (or Teco) macro
            that will convert files containing these fields
            into the new form, quickly and painlessly.


    2.  In preparation for the full implementation of
        domains, Hermes will allow arbitrary domain names.
        When a list of approved domain names is available,
        future versions of Hermes may check the validity of
        the domain name, or may continue to relay on the mail
        delivery system to do the checking.


    3.  Hermes will be brought into agreement with MM on the
        assignment of four of the bits of the machine-readable
        header (bits 30-33 on a scale of 0-35).
 
        In the current Hermes, version 4.4.6, Hermes and MM use
        different bits for the "A" mark (Answered) and for the
        Hermes Remind mark, "*", which is equivalent of he MM
        Flag mark "F".  When Hermes 4.4.7 is released, Hermes
        and MM will be compatible with respect to these marks.
 
        Hermes and MM are already in agreement on the
        assignment of bits 34 and 35, which are the bits for
        "deleted" and "seen".  The remaining bits, 0-29, are
        used by Hermes for information about refiled messages
        and by MM for the assignment of 30 keywords.
 
        Hermes 4.4.7 automatically converts old files and
        parseq files into the new MM-compatible form.  The
        current Hermes 4.4.6 uses the old form, but accepts
        files in the new form and converts them back to the old
        form.  Hermes sites should plan to retire all pre-4.4.6
        versions of Hermes before installing 4.4.7 as either
        Hermes or NewHermes.  If this is done, there should be
        no problems of convertibility.  (There will be some
        inefficiency and slowness if users switch back and
        forth between 4.4.6 and 4.4.7 frequently, converting
        their files each time, so system managers should not
        encourage this practice.)


Please send comments, suggestions, etc., to me or to HERMES@BBNA.
I will redistribute messages addressed to HERMES@BBNA that seem
to be of general interest.  This is to say that I will set up an
informal HERMES interest-group and mailing list, if people are
interested.
