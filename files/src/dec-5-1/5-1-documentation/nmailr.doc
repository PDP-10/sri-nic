NMAILR.DOC -- Changes from V4(30) to V5(32)
October 1981



1.0  SUMMARY

NMAILR is a systems program which allows users  to  send  messages  to
users  at  other sites on the ARPANET.  Messages sent by SNDMSG may be
stored in the sender's disk area and then sent  over  the  ARPANET  by
NMAILR.   If  the remote site is down NMAILR tries to send the message
again later.



2.0  EXTERNAL CHANGES

There are no external changes in NMAILR for Release 5.



3.0  KNOWN BUGS AND DEFICIENCIES

None.



4.0  INSTALLATION AND BUILD INSTRUCTIONS


4.1  Files Needed to Run NMAILR

NMAILR consists of one file, NMAILR.EXE.

NMAILR creates the file <SYSTEM>MAILER.FLAGS to keep  track  of  users
that have mail to be sent over the ARPANET.


4.2  Instructions for Loading and Installing NMAILR

Mount the tape labeled  Installation  Tape  on  MTA0:   and  type  the
following commands:

     NMAILR.MAC

In addition, the following files must be in SYS:

     MACSYM.UNV
     MONSYM.UNV


4.4  Instructions for Building NMAILR
