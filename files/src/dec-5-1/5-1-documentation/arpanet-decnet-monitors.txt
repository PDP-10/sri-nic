The  following file documents the procedures for building TOPS-20 APRA monitors
with the DECNET code enabled. It is expected that individuals using  this  file
have experience building TOPS-20 monitors and are familiar with the ARPANET. If
this is not the case, have your local software specialist call the Marlboro Hot
Line for assistance.

Normally  TOPS-20 ARPA monitors are not built with the DECNET code enabled. Due
to monitor address space limitations the AN-MONLGE.EXE monitor cannot be built.
We suggest that if you wish to build a monitor with both ARPANET and DECNET you
tailor the parameter files to the requirements of your system. Only one  source
module  (other  than STG.MAC) must be recompiled. TTYSNV.REL must be recompiled
using ARPAD.MAC rather than ARPAF.MAC. TTYSND.REL is  a  TTYSNV.REL  recompiled
with ARPAD.MAC.

To  build  a  TOPS-20AN  monitor  with  DECNET  the following modifications and
procedures must be followed:

1.     Edit  the  parameter file for the monitor you are building. The value of
       symbol DCN must be changed from zero to four. (The parameter file is the
       file used to compile STGAN.MAC. eg. ANPBIG.MAC.)

2.     The  symbol NTTMCB must be defined (in the parameter file) to the number
       of DECNET virtual terminals you  wish  your  monitor  to  support.  (eg.
       NTTMCB==:^D16).

3.     The  command  file  TTYSND.CCL  must  be  applied  to  MAKLIB to replace
       TTYSNV.REL in T20AN.REL with TTYSND.REL. eg:

			@R MAKLIB
			*@TTYSND.CCL
			*^Z

4.     Rebuild  your  monitor  using T20-AN.CTL. The psect values in LNKANS.CCL
       will probably have to be adjusted for your monitor.
