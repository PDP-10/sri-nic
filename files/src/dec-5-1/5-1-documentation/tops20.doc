                                                                Page 6


NEW FEATURES IN Version 5


Some specific new features in Version 5 are as follows:


1.  Extended-addressing support

There were some facilities in Version 4 that  allowed  programmers  to
make  limited  use  of the hardware facilities of extended addressing.
These software facilities were not formally supported, and could  only
be enabled by patching the distributed TOPS-20 monitor.

Version  5  contains  a  full  implementation  of  extended-addressing
support.   These  facilities are available currently only to the Macro
programmer.  Future language support for these facilities is  planned.
The facilities that were available in Version 4 have been expanded and
are now a fully supported portion of the  monitor.   These  facilities
allow  programmers  to  create  and  manipulate  multi-section address
spaces.  Please consult the TOPS-20 Monitor  Calls  Reference  Manual,
Monitor  Calls  User's  Guide,  and  System  Reference Manual for more
information relating to the monitor support for extended-addressing.

There have been some additional enhancements made in several  programs
which  give  the  user  greater  control over the use of multi-section
programs.  These features are contained in the following products:

          a.  DDT

          A new switch has been added to the DDT command.  The  syntax
          is:

             @DDT/USE-SECTION:n

          where "n" is the number of the extended section that DDT  is
          to  be  loaded into by the EXEC.  This feature allows easier
          debugging of  programs  which  are  running  in  a  non-zero
          section.

          b.  EXEC

          A new switch has also  been  added  to  the  GET  and  MERGE
          commands   which  is  similar  in  function  to  the  switch
          described above.  Its syntax is:

             @MERGE file.typ/USE-SECTION:n

             @GET file.typ/USE-SECTION:n

          In addition, the EXEC can now save multi-section programs in
          their entirety, or any portion
          thereof.

          Refer to the TOPS-20 COmmands Reference  Manual  Update  for
          information on the /USE-SECTION:  switch.
                                                                Page 7


          c.  LINK

          The LINK program has also been enhanced so that it  can  now
          link   multi-section  programs.   Please  consult  the  LINK
          Reference Manual update for further information.


2.  Homogeneous Network Command Terminals

Version 5 includes support for homogeneous command  terminals  through
the use of a new SETHOST feature.  This feature is implemented through
the use of a program called SETHOST which enables a time-sharing  user
to establish a logical DECnet link to another computer system which is
physically connected to  the  user's  primary  system.   All  terminal
interactions  which this user initiates will subsequently be processed
by the "linked-to" system.  This  allows  a  user  whose  terminal  is
physically  connected  to  one  system  to  be  able  to log in, issue
commands, and run programs on  a  second  system  exactly  as  if  the
terminal  was physically connected to that second system.  There is an
escape  character  which  allows  the  connection  to  be  broken  and
interaction with the primary system re-established.

Refer to the DECnet-20 Programmer's Guide and  Operations  Manual  for
documentation on the SETHOST program.


3.  RP07 Disk Drive

The RP07 disk drive is a single spindle, 705  megabyte  (unformatted),
fixed  media,  Winchester  technolgy, disk with Massbus interface.  It
will now be fully supported for  use  with  TOPS-20  Version  5.   The
primary features of this device are:


     1.  Internal microdiagnostics

     2.  rotational position sensing

     3.  1.92MB/sec peak transfer rate

     4.  average seek time of 23 ms.

     5.  defect skipping

     6.  static dual-port capability

     7.  formatted capacity of 216376 pages (499 MByte)

Unlike the RP20 disk, an RP07 can be  used  as  the  public  structure
(PS:).   However,  an RP06 drive is still required in order to contain
the front-end file system.

Refer to the TOPS-20 System Manager's Guide and the TOPS-20 Operator's
Guide for information on the RP07.
                                                                Page 8


4.  SPEAR support

SPEAR is an error reporting and  analysis  mechanism  which  is  being
released  and  supported  with  Version 5.  SPEAR replaces the program
SYSERR which was included with TOPS-20 Version  4.   There  have  been
many   changes  within  TOPS-20  in  order  to  actually  support  the
functionality of SPEAR, but all of these changes  are  transparent  to
the  user.   There is, however, a change in the directory in which the
ERROR.SYS file resides.

Refer to the SPEAR Manual for complete information on the use of  this
product.

5.  Movement of disk packs

TOPS-20 will support the automatic recognition of disk  pack  movement
between  drives  in Version 5.  This implies that a disk pack which is
mounted on a particular drive can be moved to  another  drive  without
requiring  the pack to be formally DISMOUNTed and MOUNTed again on the
second drive.  The monitor will automatically recognize that the  disk
pack  has  been  moved, and will adjust its internal data base so that
all access to the pack will be redirected to the new drive.

6.  "Read unrestricted" file mode

A new file access mode has been implemented in Version 5.   This  mode
is  called  "read  unrestricted" mode and implies that the file can be
opened regardless of its current access by other users  of  the  file.
This  mode  is  indicated  by  setting  the  bit  OF%RDU  in the OPENF
operation.  Please consult the Monitor Calls Reference Manual for more
information.

7.  Archiving enhancements

The archiving system has been enhanced through the implementation of a
number  of new commands and directory functions.  These changes relate
primarily to the introductio of an  expiration  date  for  each  file,
either  online or offline.  A general discussion of file archiving and
migration can be found in the System Manager's Guide update.

The following is a summary list of the new archiving features:

     1.  BUILD command
        OFFLINE-EXPIRATION-DEFAULT option
        ARCHIVE-ONLINE-EXPIRED-FILES option

     2.  SET FILE EXPIRED

     3.  SET FILE ON(OFF)LINE-EXPIRATION-DATE

     4.  SET FILE RESIST

     5.  SET DIRECTORY ON(OFF)LINE-EXPIRATION-DEFAULT

Please consult the TOPS-20 Commands Reference update  for  details  of
                                                                Page 9


the use of these commands.

8.  Program data vector

Version 5 supports the creation  and  manipulation  of  "program  data
vectors".    These   vectors   contain  information  relating  to  the
characteristics of the program (for example, starting and continuation
address, etc).  These vectors are manipulated through the use of a new
JSYS called PDVOP%.  Refer to the Monitor Calls Reference  Manual  for
details of this feature.

9.  Miscellaneous EXEC enhancements

There are several miscellaneous commands that have been added  to  the
EXEC  in  Version  5.   Please refer to the TOPS-20 Commands Reference
Manual update for full details of these new commands.



10.0 SYSTEM MESSAGE LEVELS

There are  various  advisory  messages  sent  by  the  system  to  all
terminals.   These  are  divided  into two categories:  less important
(level 0) and more important (level 1).  With TOPS-20, Version 5,  the
system administrator can control the type of messages sent to all user
terminals.

The following messages are level 0:

      o Swapping space low.

      o SPT space low.

      o PS:  space low.

The following messages are level 1:

      o Shutdown messages for a shutdown more than 5 minutes away.

      o PS:  automatic expunge.

The following messages are always sent:

      o  Initial shutdown message and automatic shutdown announcements
         for shutdown 5 minutes or less away.

The system administrator can decide to allow only  level  0  messages,
only  level  1 messages, both level 0 and level 1 messages, or neither
level 0 or level 1 messages to be sent to all user terminals.   System
messages of all levels are always sent to the Operator's CTY.

Under TOPS-20, Version 5, message  level  control  is  available  only
through the SMON% JSYS.
                                                               Page 10


10.1 Why Suppress Any System Messages

System messages are a very important part of the monitor's attempt  to
provide  system  status  information  to  users  and to the operators.
However, system messages can be distracting and  annoying  for  users,
especially when the user is not directly affected.

Level 0  system  messages  do  not  usually  deliver  any  significant
information  to  users.   A  message  that  swapping  space is low may
indicate to the proficient user a reason for degraded  response  time,
but may only confuse and intimidate the general user population.

Level 1 messages, on the other hand,  provide  meaningful  information
for all users.  Knowing that system shutdown is scheduled in two hours
may allow users to make important scheduling decisions, while warnings
of  automatic  expunge  on  the  public  structure will allow users to
quickly undelete important files.

With TOPS-20, Version 5, the system administrator can  decide  whether
the  minor  annoyance of interruption by system messages outweighs the
importance of the message.



10.2 Controlling System Messages

Two new functions have been defined for the SMON% JSYS:

      o .SFMS0 (function code 24) for system message level 0

      o .SFMS1 (function code 25) for system message level 1.

In addition, flags for these functions have been defined.  Flag SF%MS0
indicates  message  level  0  turned on;  that is, user terminals will
receive all level 0 system messages.  Flag  SF%MS1  indicates  message
level  1  turned on;  that is, user terminals will receive all level 1
system messages.

To set or clear system message levels, use a short MACRO-20 routine or
DDT.  As with other SMON% functions, WHEEL or OPERATOR privileges must
be enabled.

A separate SMON%  call  must  be  issued  for  each  function  setting
desired.  To use the SMON% JSYS, AC1 must contain the desired function
code, and AC2 must contain the new value for the specified function.

Refer  to  the  TOPS-20  Monitor  Calls  Reference  Manual  for   more
information on using the SMON% JSYS.



10.3 Determining The Current Settings For System Message Levels

The current settings for system message levels can be tested with  the
TMON%  JSYS.   The  function  codes  are the same.  As with SMON%, the
                                                               Page 11


TMON% JSYS requires a function code in AC1.  The current value of  the
function specified in AC1 is returned in AC2.

Refer  to  the  TOPS-20  Monitor  Calls  Reference  Manual  for   more
information on using the TMON% JSYS.
                                                               Page 12


PACKAGING FOR TOPS-20 VERSION 5


There are some minor differences in the  packaging  of  Version  5  in
comparison to the packaging of Version 4.  Specifically, the following
packaging changes have been made:


     1.  The  Version  5  Installation  tape  contains  all  supported
         TOPS-20 monitors.  That is, there is no separate ARPA monitor
         tape as there was in Version 4.


     2.  The <NEW-SYSTEM> and <NEW-SUBSYS> directories have  NOT  been
         duplicated  on  the  Version  5 Installation and Distribution
         tapes, as was the case with Release 4.  These directories  do
         NOT appear on the Version 5 Distribution tape;  they are only
         on the Installation tape.

     3.  There is a new saveset on the  Version  5  Installation  tape
         called  <GALAXY-SUBSYS>.   This  directory  contains  all the
         GALAXY components, both in UNV and EXE  format.   The  GALAXY
         sources  remain  in  a  separate  saveset on the Distribution
         tape.  Note that the GALAXY included on this tape will be the
         Version 4 GALAXY (i.e., field-image).
