1.0  SUMMARY

For Version 5.1 of TOPS-20,  the  command  RUNOFF  invokes  the  text-
processing  program  DIGITAL  Standard  Runoff  (DSR). This version of
Runoff is now fully supported by DIGITAL on both TOPS-20 and  VAX/VMS.
It  replaces  both  the  old,  MACRO-10 version of Runoff (here called
RUNOFF/10) and the earlier, unsupported versions of  DSR  provided  on
CUSP tapes since TOPS-20 Version V4.0.

Files prepared for RUNOFF/10 should produce identical output  in  most
cases  when  processed through DIGITAL Standard Runoff. For a detailed
list of the (mostly minor) differences, see the BEWARE file  provided,
RUNOFF.BWR.

DIGITAL Standard Runoff is a  native  TOPS-20  program.  It  processes
files  with  long  TOPS-20  names.  When run interactively, it has the
usual TOPS-20 command completion and incremental help facilities.


2.0  EXTERNAL CHANGES

See the Beware file provided, RUNOFF.BWR, for a detailed list  of  the
differences  in  processing  between  RUNOFF/10  and  DIGITAL Standard
Runoff.

External differences between DSR V1.125 and the current V2.1-03 are:

  1.  V1.125 was  a  TOPS-10  compatibility  program.  V2.1-03  has  a
      TOPS-20 native command-line interface.

  2.  In V1.125, multiple footnotes that were  cumulatively  too  long
      for  the  current  page would be deferred to the next page; they
      would not  be  separated.  This  would  sometimes  result  in  a
      "cascade"  in  which  all  footnotes  appeared at the end of the
      document. In V2.1-03, multiple footnotes  are  distributed  over
      several pages when necessary if there is not room on the current
      page.

  3.  In V1.125, header-level text longer than the current margins was
      output as-is, violating the margin, without an error message. In
      V2.1-03, such long header-level text wraps and fills between the
      margins.


3.0  KNOWN BUGS AND DEFICIENCIES

If you interrupt DSR with CTRL/C while at the RUNOFF> prompt, and then
use  CONTINUE, the program does not reprompt. Use CTRL/R at this point
to retrieve the prompt. This problem will be fixed in a later version.

4.0  INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

Does not apply; DSR is installed as part of the utilities bundled with
the monitor.


5.0  INTERNAL CHANGES

DSR is a complete rewrite of RUNOFF/10.

Many internal changes have been made in DSR  between  V1.125  and  the
present  DSR  V2.1-03;  with  the exception of those noted above, they
should not be visible to the user.


6.0  SUGGESTIONS

6.1  How To Tell Whether You Are Running RUNOFF/10 Or DSR

DSR's prompt is "RUNOFF>", while that of RUNOFF/10 is "*".

DSR's version number  is  2(103),  as  shown  by  INFORMATION  (ABOUT)
VERSION.  Also,  if  you  specify the /LOG switch when running DSR, it
reports its version number upon termination as V2.1-03 (by default  it
does not report it).

DSR is a native TOPS-20  program,  so  incremental  help  and  command
completion should quickly tell you if you are in fact running DSR.


6.2  List Of New DSR Commands Not Present In RUNOFF/10

For convenience, we  provide  here  the  following  list  of  new  DSR
