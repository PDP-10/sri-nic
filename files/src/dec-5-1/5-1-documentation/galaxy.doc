SUMMARY


1.0  SUMMARY

     GALAXY 4.2 is a maintenance release of the  GALAXY  system.
     The  GALAXY  system  consists  of  peripheral  spoolers,  a
     subsystem for batch  processing,  facilities  for  operator
     communication  with  users  and with the rest of the GALAXY
     system, and subsystem utilities.  The release of GALAXY 4.2
     includes a maintenance release of the TOPS-20 2780/3780 E/T
     V2.1,   TOPS-20   2780/3780/HASP    V1.1,    and    TOPS-20
     2780/3780/HASP  for  the 2020 V1.1 products.  Each of these
     three products requires a separate license.

     GALAXY 4.2 will run under TOPS-20 V5.1 or later and TOPS-20
     V4.1  or  later  on  a  KS and a KL Model A.  GALAXY 4.2 is
     required to run the maintenance  releases  of  the  IBMcomm
     software  mentioned  above.  Pleaes note, however, that the
     TOPS-20   2780/3780   E/T   and   TOPS-20    2780/3780/HASP
     maintenance releases are NOT supported for KL Model As.

     This release includes  a  general  cleanup  of  the  GALAXY
     system.   The major enhancements are described below.  As a
     part of this  release  there  have  been  changes  made  to
     various displays to provide more complete information.



2.0  COMPONENTS

     GALAXY 4.2 consists of the following components:

      o  BATCON     The batch control program

      o  CDRIVE     The card-reader input spooler

      o  GALGEN     A program for customizing the GALAXY
                    configuration

      o  GLXLIB     The GALAXY system subroutine library

      o  LPTSPL     The line-printer output spooler

      o  OPR        The operator command interpreter

      o  ORION      The operator command and message processor

      o  PLEASE     The user to operator communication program

      o  QMANGR     A queue interface for non GALAXY software

      o  QUASAR     The central queue manager and task scheduler

      o  SPRINT     The card interpreter

COMPONENTS


      o  SPROUT     An output spooler for card punch and
                    paper-tape punch




3.0  MAJOR ENHANCEMENTS

     The primary enhancements and  changes  in  GALAXY  4.2  are
     outlined in the following sections.



     3.1  Improvements To The Operator Interface.

     The operator interface has  been  modified,  although  most
     commands  have  remained the same.  A NEXT command has been
     added, and the operator messages and  responses  have  been
     standardized.  Details are as follows.

      o  The NEXT command has been added to OPR.   This  command
         allows  the operator to force a resource to be given to
         a specific request regardless  of  its  previous  queue
         position.  This comand can be used on requests from the
         following queues:

          *  BATCH-STREAM

          *  CARD-PUNCH

          *  PAPER-TAPE-PUNCH

          *  PRINTER


      o  OPR response messages required by  spoolers  have  been
         standardized  so  that  the  OPR-spooler  interface  is
         easier to use.

      o  The output from SHOW STATUS NETWORKS has been  altered,
         so  that  the node names are now output in alphabetical
         order.

      o  The ROUTE command has been rewritten to allow a user to
         reroute output from one device to another device on the
         same system.

MAJOR ENHANCEMENTS


     3.2  Improvement To Spoolers.


      o  QUASAR will now calculate queue limits more accurately.

      o  SPRINT will now  process  both  card  reader  and  disk
         files.




     3.3  GLXLIB

     There have been incompatible changes made to GLXLIB.  Users
     who  use  GLXLIB  in their non-GALAXY software will need to
     reassemble and relink their programs because  file  formats
     and messages have been changed.  Since the entry vector for
     the GLXLIB library has been standardized,  future  releases
     of the library should not require reassembly.



     3.4  Master Queue File

     Changes have been made to the master queue  files  entries.
     When  installing  GALAXY 4.2, it is necessary to delete the
     old master queue file prior to running GALAXY 4.2.   If  it
     is necessary to revert to GALAXY 4.0, the master queue file
     must be deleted at that time also.



4.0  DOCUMENTATION

The manuals updated to reflect changes due to GALAXY 4.2 were:

TOPS-20 Operator's Command Language Reference Manual

TOPS-20 User Utilities

TOPS-20 Operator's Guide

(TOPS-20 KL Model B Installation Guide updated both  for  GALAXY
4.2 and for TOPS-20 5.1)



5.0  TOPS-20 DEPENDENCIES


      o  GALAXY V4.2 will be supported on both TOPS-20  V5.1  or
         later  for  KL Model B and on TOPS-20 V4.1 or later for
         KS and KL Model A.
GALAXY.DOC -- Changes form Version 4.0 to Version 4.2     Page 5
TOPS-20 DEPENDENCIES


      o  The TOPS-20 EXEC has been assembled with GALAXY V4.2.

      o  TOPS-20 DUMPER Release 4 which is shipped with  TOPS-20
         Release  5.1  will  require  a patch to run with GALAXY
         4.2.  See the GALAXY.BWR file for the required patch.

      o  MOUNTR has been rebuilt to run with GALAXY 4.2.  A copy
         of the rebuilt MOUNTR.EXE is on the installation tape.

      o  OPR/ORION and NFT/FAL may need to be rebuilt  depending
         upon  which GALAXY and DECNET combination is used.  See
         GALAXY.BWR for more details.




6.0  INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

Before installing GALAXY 4.2, be sure to read the .BWR file  and
the    appropriate    installation    guide   for   installation
instructions.  For KL Model Bs that is the TOPS-20  KL  Model  B
Installation Guide and for KS and KL Model As, it is the TOPS-20
KS/KL Model A Installation Guide.
