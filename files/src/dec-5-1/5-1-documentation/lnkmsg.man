                                    LINK MESSAGES                                    LINK MESSAGES



        This appendix lists all of LINK's messages.  (The  messages  from  the
        Overlay Handler, which have the OVL prefix, are given in Chapter 5.)



        B.1  DESCRIPTION OF MESSAGES             DESCRIPTION OF MESSAGES

        Section B.2 lists LINK's messages.  For each message, the  last  three
        letters  of  the  6-letter  code,  the  level,  the  severity, and its
        medium-length message are given in boldface.  Then, in lightface type,                                           boldface
        comes the long message.

        When a message is issued,  the  three  letters  are  suffixed  to  the
        letters LNK, forming a 6-letter code of the form LNKxxx.

        The level of a message determines whether it will  be  issued  to  the
        terminal,  the  log  file,  or  both.  You can use the /ERRORLEVEL and
        /LOGLEVEL switches to control message output.  For  some  messages  an
        asterisk  (*) is given for the level or severity.  This means that the
        value is variable, and depends on the conditions  that  generated  the
        message.

        The severity  of  a  message  determines  whether  the  load  will  be
        terminated  when  the message is issued.  Table B-1 lists the severity
        codes used in LINK, along with their meanings.  The  /SEVERITY  switch
        provides a means for lowering the severity that is considered fatal.

        The severity also determines the first character on the  message  line
        printed  to  the  terminal.   This character can then be detected with
        Batch's error facility.  For all informational messages, the character
        is [.  Warnings use %, and fatal errors use ?.

          Code                             Meaning


           1-7      Informational;   messages  of  this  severity  generally
                    indicate LINK's progress through the load.

          8-15      Warning;  LINK is able to recover by itself and continue
                    the load.

            16      Warning if timesharing, but fatal and stops the load  if
                    batch.

            20      Fatal;  LINK can only partially recover and continue the
                    load.   The  loaded program may be incorrect.  Undefined
                    symbols cause this action.

            24      This is for file access errors.  Under  batch,  this  is
                    fatal  and stops the load.  Under timesharing, this is a
                    warning,  and  LINK  prompts  for   the   correct   file
                    specification if possible.

            31      Always fatal;  LINK stops the load.



        The /VERBOSITY switch determines whether the  medium-length  and  long
        messages  are  issued.   If  you  use /VERBOS:SHORT, only the 6-letter
        code,  the  level,  and  the  severity  are  issued.    If   you   use
        /VERBOS:MEDIUM,  the medium-length message is also issued.  If you use
        /VERBOS:LONG, the code, level, severity,  medium-length  message,  and
        long message are issued.

        Those portions of the medium-length messages enclosed in braces ({ and
        }) are optional, and are only printed in appropriate circumstances.

        Those portions  of  the  medium-length  messages  enclosed  in  square
        brackets  are  filled  in  at  run-time  with  values pertinent to the
        particular  error.   Table  B-2  describes  each  of  these  bracketed
        quantities.

                               Special Message Segments

          [area]       The name of one of LINK's internal memory  management
                       areas.

          [date]       The date on which LINK was run.

          [decimal]    A decimal number, such as a node number.

          [device]     A device name.

          [file]       A file specification.

          [label]      An internal label in LINK.

          [memory]     A memory size, such as 17P.

          [name]       The name of the  loaded  program  or  a  node  in  an
                       overlaid program.

          [octal]      An octal number, such as a symbol value.

          [reason]     The reason for a file  access  failure,  one  of  the
                       messages from Table B-3.

          [switch]     The name of a switch associated with the error.

          [symbol]     The name of a symbol, such as a subroutine or  common
                       block name.

          [type]       The type or attributes associated with a symbol.



        Whenever possible, LINK attempts  to  indicate  the  module  and  file
        associated  with  an  error.   This  information represents the module
        currently being processed by LINK, and may not always  be  the  actual
        module  containing  the  error.   For  instance,  if  LINK  detects  a
        multiply-defined symbol, either value may be the  incorrect  one.   In
        this  case, LINK reports only the second (and subsequent) redefinition
        and the module containing it.

                         You  loaded  programs   containing   more   ambiguous
                         subroutine requests than can fit in the tables of one
                         or more overlay links.  You received a LNKARL message
                         for  each ambiguous request, and a LNKTMA message for
                         each link with too many requests.  You can solve this
                         problem  in  either  of  two ways.  One is to use the
                         /ARSIZE  switch  before  the  /OVERLAY  switch,  thus
                         expanding  all  the  tables.  The other is to use the
                         /ARSIZE switch  just  before  each  /LINK  switch  to
                         expand the tables separately.

                         Either  load  the  module with the largest definition
                         first, or use the /COMMON:   switch  to  reserve  the
                         needed space.

                         LINK error.  This message is not expected  to  occur.

                         More than one successor link can satisfy a call  from
                         an  ancestor  link.   The  ancestor  link requests an
                         entry point that is contained in two or more  of  its
                         successors.  You should revise your overlay structure
                         to remove the ambiguity.

                         If you execute the current load, one of the following
                         will occur when the ambiguous call is executed:

                         in memory, the one with the most links of its path in
                         memory will be called.

                         causes for the error are:  a table is too long  (more
                         than  218 words);  or a table that should have paired
                         words has an odd length.  LNKB4R is usually  followed
                         by a fatal error.

                         The name you gave with the /NODE switch  is  not  the

                         The length of LINK's low  segment  differs  from  the
                         length stored in the current LINK high segment.  This
                         occurs if some but not all of LINK's EXE  files  have
                         been  updated  after  rebuilding  LINK  from sources.

                         Your use of the /NODE switch shows that you  want  to
                         begin a new overlay link, but the current link is not
                         yet completely loaded.  LINK assumes a  /LINK  switch
                         immediately preceding the /NODE switch, and loads the
                         link (without a link name).

                         The named module contains  a  new  definition  of  an

                         is still too large for available memory.  A  probable
                         cause is a large global symbol table, which cannot be
                         overflowed to disk.

                         You must use the /MIXFOR switch to load a mixture  of

                         The current value of MAXCOR is too small for LINK  to

                         LINK needs more space than you gave with the /MAXCOR:

                         indicate  a link before the root link.  (For example,
                         from a position after the third link in a  path,  you
                         cannot give /NODE:-4.)

                         blocks (name) without an intervening end,  or  if  an
                         end-of-file  is  found  before the end block is seen.
                         LINK simulates the missing end block.  However, fatal
