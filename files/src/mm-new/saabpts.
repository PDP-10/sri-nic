I have a collection of parts for SAAB 96s:  several 2-stroke engines, a
V-4 with a bad crank shaft (I think), several transmissions, numerous
body parts (light lenses, guages, steering wheels, etc.), a steering
rack or two, and lots of other stuff.  I no longer have any use for
these, and would like to see them go to someone who has.  They are
available at very reasonable prices.  Please let me know if you are
interested, or if you know of someone who is (I hate to take this stuff
to a junk yard, or sell it for scrap).
