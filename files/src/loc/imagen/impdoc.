DviImp translates Dvi files into Imp files.  

DviImp's default file format is in 8-bit bytes, 4 bytes left justified in 32 bits.

Appending the switch "/o9" to the input file given to DviImp will produce 9-bit
byte format needed for the program RdImp.

In case you forget how to do PupFTP, look at SenEDM[ras,dmo].  PupFTP responds
briefly to "help".

The following is a brief description of the files that make up DviImp.

impdef.sai[ras,dmo]	- defines the ImPress command code constants
impfun.sai[ras,dmo]	- defines the ImPress command procedures.  These are
				called to output an ImPress command base on
				procedure parameters

impio.sai[ras,dmo]	- contains byte input and output routines.  Output goes
			either to one of two buffers or to the output file.
			except for the 4 header words of the output file
			and the end-of-file command, only ImpFun routines
				do output

impfon.sai[ras,dmo]	- font-format specific routines, calls glyph definition
				functions
imputs.sai[ras,dmo]	- some utilities used by ImpInp
impinp.sai[ras,dmo]	- dvi input routines

impage.sai[ras,dmo]	- handles the logic for the page

imagen.sai[sai,ras]	- a few octal defs for file type ids
makfil.sai[sai,ras]	- for mucking with extensions and directories
bitman.sai[sai,ras]	- clever bit manipulation stuff, not used much by dviimp
draw.sai[sai,ras]	- for debugging, drawing chars
iobyte.sai[sai,ras]	- for doing 8 or 9 bit io
