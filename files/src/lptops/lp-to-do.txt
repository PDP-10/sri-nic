	      ======================

1) Fix page reversal scheme
	- Make sure no type conversions on done on page_table and
		results of ftells.  (should all be long's).
	- Change page reversal scheme to use legal use of fseek.
		Make routine:  copy(pagenum)  instead of copying between
		offsets (which not supported for text streams on TOPS-20).

2) Get the appropriate default settings to match normal speedy defaults.

3) Finish commenting their code.
