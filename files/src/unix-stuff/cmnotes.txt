		      Notes on the CCMD package


ARL, 2/17/85: If the Lattice C compiler complains that it cannot find
an included header file under MSDOS, the problem could be that your
FILES limit is set too low in your \CONFIG.SYS file.  This is especially
likely for the system header file setjmp.h, which is included by
ccmdmd.h, which is included by ccmd.h, which is included by programs
using ccmd.
