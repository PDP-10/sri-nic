USAG20.DOC -- Version 3(5)
November 1984



1.0  SUMMARY

USAG20 is a general purpose downstream billing program with Category C
support.   It  uses  the new USAGE file format (see DECSYSTEM-20 USAGE
File Specification for a complete description) as input and optionally
outputs four reports.  These are:

     1.  System usage sorted by user name.

     2.  System usage sorted by account.

     3.  Disk usage sorted by directory name.

     4.  Disk usage sorted by account.

Read USAG20.HLP for instructions on running this program.

The released version of USAG20.EXE does not depend  on  any  software.
However,  if you wish to recompile this program, COBOL V12 and SORT V4
or later will be needed.  COBOL must be COBOL-68.
