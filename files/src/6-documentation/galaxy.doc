     1.0  SUMMARY

     GALAXY version 5 is  a  release  primarily  aimed  at  supporting
     changes  in  TOPS-20  version  6.  The major areas include QUEUE%
     JSYS support, CI support, CFS  support  and  password  encryption
     support.   Due  to  these needs, a significant amount of work was
     also done to MOUNTR to improve its internal operations.  Finally,
     GALAXY 5 also contains published changes to GALAXY 4.2.



     2.0  QUEUE% JSYS SUPPORT

     This release has  a  new  mechanism  for  sending  certain  queue
     requests and operator messages to GALAXY components under program
     control.  For further information see the Monitor Calls Reference
     manual.



     3.0  SYSTEM INFORMATION MESSAGES TO OPR

     The first use of the QUEUE% JSYS is by the  monitor  which  sends
     BUGCHK,  BUGINF,  and system messages to ORION/OPR.  In addition,
     output  of  these  classes  of  messages   can   be   selectively
     enabled/disabled with new ENABLE/DISABLE OUTPUT-DISPLAY options.



     4.0  MOUNT/DISMOUNT STRUCTURES

     With CFS, structures may be used by more than one system.   As  a
     result, there are more possible states of a particular structure.
     Some examples include:

      o  A  structure  can  be  mounted  by  all  systems  in  a   CFS
         configuration.

      o  A structure can be mounted  by  only  one  system  in  a  CFS
         configuration.

      o  It may be desirable to remove a structure  from  use  by  one
         system  in  a  CFS  configuration while leaving the structure
         available for use by other systems in a CFS configuration.

      o  It may be desirable to remove a structure physically  from  a
         CFS configuration.

                                                                Page 2


     Additional functions have been added to OPR to  aid  in  managing
     these states.



     4.1  MOUNT

     There is now a MOUNT STRUCTURE FOO:  command  available  in  OPR.
     Its  behavior  is  different  from the user mount command in some
     respects.  It does not increment the mount count.   It  does  not
     cause  a specific request to be made of the operator to mount the
     structure.  Its actions are:

     1.  If the structure is not available to the  system,  i.e.   not
         physically  mounted  or explicitly set unavailable, it sets a
         pending request.  When the structure becomes available, it is
         mounted.

     2.  If the structure is "being dismounted", it clears that state.

     3.  If the structure is then available to be mounted,  the  mount
         is be performed.




     4.2  OPR>DISMOUNT With REMOVAL/NO-REMOVAL

     OPR>DISMOUNT with REMOVAL is to perform the  action  in  previous
     releases, i.e.  dismount and physically remove the structure from
     the system.  REMOVAL is now an option to the  DISMOUNT  STRUCTURE
     command  in  OPR.  In a non-CFS environment, the command performs
     as in the past.  In a  CFS  configuration,  the  removal  has  an
     additional  step.  This is because the structure may be in use by
     another system.  As a result, MOUNTR on the system performing the
     request  internally  attempts  to  set the structure exclusive to
     this system (more  on  exclusive  later).   If  successful,  then
     MOUNTR  on  this system has complete control of the structure and
     can ask the operator to remove the structure safely.   If  MOUNTR
     is unable to set the structure exclusive to this system, then the
     operator is asked to dismount the structure from other systems in
     the  CFS  configuration  with  no-removal.   After  that  task is
     accomplished, the  operator  returns  to  the  first  system  and
     indicates  proceed.  When MOUNTR believes it has complete control
     of the structure, the dismount will be completed and the operator
     (through OPR) will be instructed to remove the structure.

     Dismount with NO-REMOVAL is the new action.  Due to CFS it may be
     desirable  to dismount a structure from a system without removing
     the structure (That is, halt one system's use of  the  structure)
     thus allowing another system in the CFS configuration to continue
     using the structure and/or gain complete control of the structure
     (exclusive).   This function is required to support dismount with
     removal in CFS.  In the NO-REMOVAL case,  the  operator  will  be
     informed  that the structure has been dismounted from this system
                                                                Page 3


     but the structure is not to be  removed  (since  other  users  on
     another   system  may  be  actively  using  the  structure).   In
     addition, the structure cannot be used  from  this  system  until
     either  the structure has been removed (through action by another
     system in the  CFS  configuration)  or  the  structure  has  been
     mounted  with the OPR>MOUNT STRUCTURE FOO:  command.  This action
     of preventing furtuer use also occurs in the remove case  if  the
     structure is not physically removed.



     4.3  Default Actions With Dismount

     If no option is given, and if the system is not  part  of  a  CFS
     configuration,  the DISMOUNT STRUCTURE command proceeds as in the
     past and the structure processing requests the operator to remove
     the structure.  If however, the system is determined by MOUNTR to
     be part of a CFS configuration, the default  is  NO-REMOVAL.   In
     the  case  of  the  user dismount request, the action of the EXEC
     DISMOUNT STRUCTURE /REMOVE command is the same  as  the  operator
     DISMOUNT   REMOVAL   command   with   the  additional  action  of
     decrementing the mount count for the structure.



     5.0  NEW STRUCTURE ATTRIBUTE EXCLUSIVE/SHARED

     With CFS a structure can be set to be available  to  one  system.
     If a structure is set this way with the OPR command SET STRUCTURE
     FOO:  EXCLUSIVE, only users on the system where  the  command  is
     executed  are  able  to access the structure.  SET STRUCTURE FOO:
     SHARED allows either system in the CFS configuration to  use  the
     structure.   Note  that the set structure exclusive command fails
     if the system is unable to get it  exclusive,  i.e.   if  another
     system  is  already  using  the  structure.   In  that  case, the
     structure must be  dismounted  with  no-removal  from  the  other
     system  before  the SET STRUCTURE EXCLUSIVE command is allowed to
     succeed.

     Note that this exclusive to system is different from the previous
     to  release  6  attribute exclusive to job.  The exclusive to job
     attribute is used/has been used by CHECKD to maintain control  of
     a  structure  during  certain  operations.   The exclusive to job
     attribute has a CFS wide effect, that is, no other system in  CFS
     will be able to use the structure.  GALAXY offers no control over
     the exclusive to job attribute.
                                                                Page 4


     6.0  STATIC STRUCTURE ATTRIBUTES

     The way structure attributes are managed has been changed.   When
     a  structure attribute is set through an OPR command (such as SET
     STRUCTURE FOO:  DOMESTIC), the structure retains  that  attribute
     across   system  crashes.   This  information  is  maintained  in
     SYSTEM:DEVICE-STATUS.BIN by MOUNTR.



     6.1  MOUNTR.CMD

     Since MOUNTR maintains the structure  attributes  in  a  separate
     file,  MOUNTR.CMD is no longer supported or referenced by MOUNTR.
     It is however, reasonable to take the  information  contained  in
     MOUNTR.CMD  and convert it into an OPR command file.  This can be
     used for a starting point should some disk failure occur  causing
     the DEVICE-STATUS.BIN file to be damaged.



     6.2  OPR>SHOW STATUS STRUCTURE Display

     All of the structure  information  has  been  moved  into  a  new
     structure   display.    This  was  particularly  needed  since  a
     structure can now have attributes assigned to it  whether  it  is
     currently   mounted   or   not.    There   are   three  switches,
     /ALL(default), /MOUNTED and /UNMOUNTED.  For each structure,  the
     following information is provided:

      o  Structure alias

      o  Structure name (if mounted)

      o  Mount state

      o  Mount count (if mounted)

      o  Open file count (if mounted)

      o  Status - Avail, Unavail or Ignored

      o  Shared/Exclusive access

      o  Domestic/Foreign access

      o  Regulated/Unregulated

     Note that the data base is keyed off the  structure  alias  only.
     As  a result, mounting any structure name with a particular alias
     gives that disk pack  the  correct  attributes.   Attributes  are
     associated only with the alias.  Also, since the public structure
     cannot  have  the  domestic/foreign   and   regulated/unregulated
     attributes  changed,  those fields are overwritten with a message
     indicating the structure is the primary public structure.
                                                                Page 5


     6.3  OPR>SHOW STATUS STRUCTURE FOO:  Display

     In  addition  to  displaying  multiple  structures,  it  is  also
     possible  to  display  only  a  single structure.  In addition to
     containing a single line with headers from the normal SHOW STATUS
     STRUCTURE  display,  a number of other items are included.  Lines
     containing a partial SHOW STATUS DISK display, which contains the
     packs  of  the structure is included.  Also included is a list of
     users that have currently MOUNTed, ACCESSed, or CONNECTed to this
     structure.  This display should contain sufficient information to
     make decisions about the structure.



     6.4  OPR>UNDEFINE STRUCTURE

     Even though  structure  information  is  not  deleted  due  to  a
     structure  dismount,  it  may be desirable to remove a particular
     structure from the structure data base.   (Dropped  pack  on  the
     floor,  gone  forever)  To  accomplish this, use the OPR>UNDEFINE
     STRUCTURE foo:  command.  It removes all  information  about  the
     structure  and  its  attributes  from  MOUNTR's  data base.  This
     command fails if the structure is currently in use.



     7.0  NEW OPR>SHOW STATUS DISK-DRIVE DISPLAY

     This command now presents a reorganized display.  The  left  half
     of  the  display  concerns  the  status of the disk drive and the
     right half concerns the status of the disk pack contained on  the
     drive.  Much of the structure specific information has been moved
     to the SHOW STATUS STRUCTURE display.

     The drive information contains the type of drive, the path to the
     drive  (channel,  controller,  unit), and the status of the drive
     (avail/unavail).   Note  that   this   available/unavailable   is
     different  from  a  structure available/unavailable.  If the disk
     drive is unavailable, any structure pack mounted  on  that  drive
     causes   the  entire  structure  to  be  unusable.   A  structure
     unavailable (indicated in  the  SHOW  STATUS  STRUCTURE  display)
     indicates  the structure is unavailable no matter where the packs
     for the structure are placed.

     The disk pack information in  the  display  contains  information
     regarding  the  use  of  the  pack.  The mount status (mounted or
     offline), and mount count and the name of the pack  are  included
     as  in  the past.  The usage options only contain attributes that
     may impact use of the disk pack (exclusive, unavailable,  ignored
     and alias if different from pack name).
                                                                Page 6


     In addition to the normal  display,  there  are  some  additional
     lines that may be included as needed:

      o  Channel 7 indicates CI channel

      o  (*)  indicates  potential  external  port  -   This   message
         indicates  there are massbus disk drives that are dual ported
         and  have  the  port  switch  in  the  dual  position.   This
         information is important if this is a CFS configuration.




     8.0  MOUNTR ENFORCEMENT OF STRUCTURE ATTRIBUTES

     A significant  behavior  change  is  MOUNTR's  use  of  structure
     attribute  information.   In  previous  releases,  MOUNTR  simply
     accepted the state of a structure as presented  by  the  monitor.
     With  this  release,  MOUNTR  maintains  its  own  data  base and
     enforces structure and disk attributes  where  appropriate.   For
     example, if MOUNTR detects that structure FOO is domestic when it
     is to be foreign, MOUNTR  corrects  the  attribute,  as  well  as
     notifying  the operator of the event and change.  There are three
     exceptions:

     1.  If the structure is supposed to be exclusive and has been set
         shared  through  some  other means, MOUNTR will try to return
         the structure to exclusive.  But another system  may  already
         be using the structure so MOUNTR may fail in the attempt.  In
         any case, the operator is notified.

     2.  If a structure is mounted or dismounted by some other  means,
         MOUNTR  only  notes  the  event  and  notifies  the operator.
         Dismounting a structure mounted by  some  other  means  could
         have a serious effect.

     3.  If a structure is set ignored MOUNTR  notes  changes  in  the
         state  of  the  structure  but makes no attempt to change the
         state of the structure until set acknowledged.




     9.0  MINOR CHANGES TO OPR

     9.1  OPR>PUSH Command

     OPR now obtains an EXEC using  the  logical  name  "DEFAULT-EXEC"
     which permits users to identify their own EXECs.
                                                                Page 7


     9.2  OPR>SET TERMINAL TYPE Command

     Rather than continuing  to  update  this  command  with  the  new
     terminal  types,  support  for this command is being dropped with
     this release.  The command as it exists has  been  set  invisible
     thereby  allowing  previous  use  to  continue.   The  EXEC has a
     complete set of commands for setting terminal attributes.



     9.3  OPR>SET DISK-DRIVE AVAILABLE/UNAVAILABLE Command

     An optional controller field has been added to  this  command  to
     allow  control  of  disks  that  have  explicit  controllers.  If
     ommitted, channel and drive are sufficient and  work  as  in  the
     past.



     10.0  VERSION NUMBERS ETC.

     A number of changes have been made in the version numbers and the
     edit numbers of GALAXY components.



     10.1  Version Numbers

     To eliminate some confusion that has existed, the  major  version
     number  of  all  GALAXY  components  has  been standardized.  The
     following table shows the version number changes:

     Component  old version     new version
     ---------  -----------     -----------
     QUASAR             4               5
     ORION              4               5
     OPR                4               5
     GLXLIB             1               5
     CDRIVE             1               5
     LPTSPL             104             5
     SPROUT             4               5
     SPRINT             104             5
     PLEASE             104             5
     MOUNTR             5               5       Already version 5!
     GALGEN             5               5       Already version 5!
     BATCON             104             5



     10.2  Edit Numbers

     With this release, all modules (.MAC files) have their  own  edit
     numbers.   The  edit  number of a process is generally the sum of
     the edit numbers of the modules used to build the component.   In
     addition,  the  mechanism  to  manage that has been standardized.
                                                                Page 8


     One ramification is that GLXVER has been eliminated with the edit
     information returned to the respective .MAC files.

     Each  module  has  2  edit  numbers.   One  edit  number,  xxxMAN
     generally  contains  the highest 4.2 edit number.  The other edit
     number, xxxDEV contains the version 5  number.   This  shows  the
     number   of  maintenance  edits  that  have  been  applied  to  a
     particular component  even  while  we  continue  development  and
     manage a second set of edits.  The actual edit number of the .MAC
     file is xxxEDT which  is  the  greater  of  the  other  two  edit
     numbers.



     10.3  Version Vector

     Now that we have all these neat edit numbers floating around,  we
     have   produced   a   simple  vector  that  quickly  enables  the
     determination of the versions of the components used to produce a
     particular GALAXY component.  The vectors are made up of two word
     entries that contain the name of the macro file used in sixbit in
     the  first  word, and the edit numbers in the form xxxMAN,,xxxDEV
     in the second word of the entry.  For example, OPR  contains  its
     vector  at  OPRVEC  and  contains  two  word  entries for GLXMAC,
     ORNMAC, OPR, OPRPAR, OPRCMD and NCPTAB.  The components  and  the
     names for their vectors are:

     Component        Vector Name
     ---------        -----------
     OPR              OPRVEC
     ORION            ORNVEC
     QUASAR           QSRVEC
     BATCON           BATVEC
     LPTSPL           LPTVEC
     CDRIVE           RDRVEC
     SPRINT           SPTVEC
     SPROUT           SPOVEC
     MOUNTR           MTRVEC
     PLEASE           PLSVEC
     GLXLIB           GLXVEC



     11.0  SYSTEM PROCESSES

     The following GALAXY processes are now set  to  system  processes
     for scheduling purposes:  QUASAR, ORION, BATCON and LPTSPL.  This
     should provide more consistant service from these components.  In
     addition, any process with sufficient privileges using GLXLIB can
     set itself as a  system  process  with  the  bit  IB.SYS  in  the
     initialization  block  flag  word  (IB.FLG).  This bit causes the
     process to be set as system process (JP%SYS)  unless  part  of  a
     private  world.   Its use depends on the setting of the debugging
     bits.  See next section.
                                                                Page 9


     12.0  PRIVATE WORLD CHANGES

     The use of the debugging word (DEBUGW, location 135) has  changed
     with  GALAXY  5.   In the past, setting DEBUGW to non-zero caused
     the GALAXY component to be treated as a private world.  This  has
     not changed.  What has changed is that the bits in DEBUGW can now
     have specific meanings.  The QUEUE% JSYS permits only one user to
     become  the debugging user of the JSYS.  There is a bit in DEBUGW
     that sets this private world as the debugging user.   Note,  that
     this  changes  the  use of private worlds somewhat since only one
     user may use a GALAXY debugging world to work on the QUEUE  JSYS.
     Also,  it  may  be  desirable  to  allow  a  private world to set
     components to system processes overriding the default conditions.
     There  is also a bit to support this.  The following bits are now
     defined for DEBUGW.  Note that -1 in DEBUGW  gets  the  user  all
     functions.

      o  DB.IPC -- use the system wide debugging  PIDs  (for  QUEUE%).
         (1B0)

      o  DB.SYS -- set as a system process if indicated by IB.  (1B1)

      o  DB.NOR -- normal debugging world.  (1B35)
