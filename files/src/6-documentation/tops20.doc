        1.0  PRODUCT SUMMARY

             TOPS-20 V6.0 will provide the software  required  to  use
        HSC50  controllers  and  RA81/RA60 disks, by providing support
        for the KL 2060/2065 interface to the CI (the  CI20)  and  the
        software interfaces to the new disk subsystem.

             TOPS-20 V6.0 will be a product only  on  the  KL10  based
        2060/2065   systems.    It   will   ship  in  support  of  the
        CI20/HSC50/RA81/RA60 hardware and  will  ONLY  ship  to  those
        sites  which order that hardware.  It will not, therefore be a
        full distribution to the field (and thus  will  not  supercede
        V5.1  at  all sites).  It will include updates from the latest
        Autopatch distribution at the time of its delivery  (Autopatch
        tape  8).   There  will  be  a  major  update  to  the TOPS-20
        documentation set along with this release, though it  will  be
        distributed in 'soft-copy' on an additional magtape and not as
        a hardcopy update to the existing manual set.
                                                                        Page 3


        1.1  TOPS-20 V6.0 System Facilities Specification

        The following outlines some of the major points of support  in
        V6.0, as well as certain restrictions:

        1.  TOPS-20  V6.0  and  the  CI20  require  a  KL10  Model   B
            Processor.

        2.  TOPS-20 V6.0 and the CI20 will not be  supported  on  KL10
            Model A or KS10 processors.

        3.  There can be a maximum of  ONE  CI  installed  in  a  KL10
            processor and that must be a dual path CI.

        4.  TOPS-20  V6.0  and  the  CI20   will   work   with   legal
            combinations of internal (MF20 or MB20) memory.

        5.  CI20 will not be  supported  on  external  memory  if  the
            system  uses  SA10 s, DX10 s and/or if the external memory
            is other than MH10 or MF10, configured in 4-Bus mode.

        6.  The CI20 will NOT be supported on a system  without  cache
            (NOT 2040 s)

        7.  TOPS-20 V6.0 will always  contain  the  code  for  the  CI
            support whether or not the system has a CI20.

        8.  TOPS-20 V6.0 will require  a  MINIMUM  of  768K  words  of
            memory

        9.  TOPS-20 will support a  MAXIMUM  memory  configuration  of
            3.072 megawords.

       10.  TOPS-20 V6.0 will support  RA81  and  RA60  disks  on  the
            HSC50, but will not support TA78 tapes.

       11.  TOPS-20 V6.0 will NOT support  CFS  configurations.   This
            support  will  be  available  with  the  next full TOPS-20
            distribution.

       12.  TOPS-20 V6.0 will NOT support the use of an HSC50 disk  as
            a PS:  structure.

       13.  CI20 RELOAD

            The CI20 microcode will  initially  be  loaded  at  system
            start up by a program running under SYSJOB.  During normal
            operation, this program will automatically reload the CI20
            microcode if required.  The file containing this microcode
            must be located on the massbus disk serving as PS:.

       14.  A Maximum of 3 HSC50 s per CI is Recommended
                                                                        Page 4


       15.  TOPS-20 V6.0 will support a maximum of 20 Raxx drives  per
            HSC50

       16.  TOPS-20 V6.0 will support a maximum of 60 RAxx drives  per
            CI

       17.  An RA81 disk structure may consist of 1 to 4 spindles.

       18.  ARPA (TCP/IP)

            1.  TCP/IP support will be distributed separately from the
                standard  TOPS-20 package and will ONLY be distributed
                to ARPA customers  (i.e.   those  currently  supported
                under QT031).

            2.  TCP/IP Maximum Configuration

                TOPS-20 V6.0  monitors  built  to  support  BOTH  ARPA
                (TCP/IP)  and DECnet networks will not support maximum
                configurations  ( jobs,TTY  s,  memory,etc).    At   a
                minimum,    such    monitors    will   support   those
                configurations possible under V5.1 of TOPS-20.   (This
                was  approximately  80  jobs, 2 meg W memory, 10 pages
                less JSB free space )

            3.  All TOPS-20 monitors will have  DECnet  support  built
                in.    NON-DECnet   builds  of  TOPS-20  will  not  be
                supported, except for the special case of ARPA.  Given
                that   we   will  be  restricting  the  configurations
                possible for ARPA/DECnet monitors, we will continue to
                make it possible to build non-DECnet monitors (through
                the use of an build parameter, as is now the case)  in
                combination with ARPA.

            4.  TCP/IP will NOT have NCP Capability

                The  TCP/IP  implementation  will  not   include   NCP
                capability.   NCP  is  in  the release 5 alpha test of
                TCP/IP and provides the ARPA customer with a method of
                transitioning  between the two protocols.  By the time
                V6.0 is released, there should not be a need for  this
                facility.





        2.0  DELIVERY

             TOPS-20 V6.0 will  be  delivered  as  an  update  to  all

        3.0  SOFTWARE CAPABILITIES

        This section contains a brief description of each new  feature
        in TOPS-20 V6.0.



        1.  SCA support

            This task will provide support in the Monitor to implement
            the  SCA protocol on the CI.  This includes JSYS level SCA
            support for user mode diagnostics.   SCA  is  a  corporate
            protocol  which provides process-to-process communications
            on the CI.

        2.  CI20 Support

            Provide Monitor software to drive the CI on a  KL10  using
            the  CI20 hardware.  This task includes producing software
            to:  load the port microcode,  provide  error  logging  of
            hardware  detected  errors,  and  support  for  user  mode
            diagnostics.

        3.  HSC50 Disk, Host support

            This  is  the  disk  driver  module   in   TOPS-20   which
            communicates  with  the HSC50 disk or equivalent using the
            MSCP protocol.

        4.  Diagnostic Support

            This task will add additional facilities to the DIAG  JSYS
            for user mode diagnostic support, primarily in the area of
            the CI20.
                                                                        Page 7


        5.  Larger main memory configurations

            The amount of memory that  TOPS-20  can  support  will  be
            increased  to  3.072 megawords from (about) 2.5 megawords.
            This will be done my moving the Core Status  Tables  to  a
            non-zero section.

        6.  Multi-fork capabilities in EXEC

            Multiforking is an EXEC feature  that  organizes  a  job's
            memory  into separate, parallel areas called "forks." Each
            fork contains one program and its inferior forks, if  any.
            This  organization  of  memory means users can run several
            programs simultaneously.  Furthermore, by placing  program
            forks  in the "background," the terminal is free for other
            work.  Once loaded in memory, program forks can be invoked
            without  reinitializing.   This  means  that a user can go
            from a compiler  to  an  editor  and  back  again  without
            reloading either program.

        7.  RAMP Support

            1.  BUGCHK Information

                The Monitor will provide the capability to notify  the
                operator  on a BUGCHK and other warning message cases.
                The macro defining BUGCHKs will be modified  to  allow
                the setting of a flag for operator notification.

            2.  SPEAR sequence counter

                A sequence number is added to each ERROR  file  entry.
                The  sequence  number will be implemented to increment
                across system crashes.

            3.  Auto-reload of CI20 Microcode

                Upon detection of a potentially recoverable failure of
                the  CI20  microcode, TOPS-20 will automatically cause
                the CI20 microcode to be reloaded.


        8.  Password Encryption

            TOPS-20  password  encryption  facility  increases  system
            security  by  making  it  much  more  difficult  to  steal
            passwords  and  gain   unauthorized   access   to   system
            resources/services.   Customers  may  use the DEC-supplied
            encryption algorithm or they  may  write  their  own.   An
            important  feature is a password encryption version number
            that  allows  changes  to  or  replacement  of  encryption
            algorithms  without affecting passwords encrypted with the
            older algorithm.
                                                                        Page 8


        9.  CHECKD

            This utility has had a large amount of  maintenance  work,
            especially  in  terms  of  error  handling (bad arguments,
            etc.), as well as an update  to  use  extended  addressing
            (separate  sections  for code and data), thus allowing for
            dealing with larger structures and for mapping in DDT.

       10.  DUMPER

            The only development changes  being  made  to  DUMPER  for
            TOPS-20  V6.0  are  the inclusion of the changes necessary
            for supporting Password encryption and PPN-support.

       11.  PTYCON

            This utility was updated to use the  COMND  JSYS  for  its
            command   parsing,  making  it  compatible  with  standard
            TOPS-20 command syntax.

       12.  PPN support

            To implement more complete support of PPNs in  TOPS-20,  a
            word was added to the directory and IDXTAB was extended to
            include a PPN.  Changes were made to DUMPER, DLUSR, CHECKD
            and the EXEC build command.

       13.  Active dual porting of Massbus Disks

            Support was  added  to  allow  for  dual  porting  massbus
            disks(RP04,RP06,RP07) to two different channels within the
            same KL, allowing for the use  of  one  channel  when  the
            other is active .

       14.  ARPANET TCP/IP

            The TCP/IP support currently in  the  field  with  TOPS-20
            V5.4 has been integrated into the V6.0 monitor.

       15.  Address space:  While not part of the user  functionality,
            there  does  exist  a  major  sub-project  within  V6.0 of
            TOPS-20   which   is   aimed   at   supplying   sufficient
            code-section  address  space  to create reasonable monitor
            configurations.

            See appendix A for more details.

       16.  Galaxy Changes

            Galaxy has been enhanced to support the change in  TOPS-20
            V6.0,   particularly   those   relating   to  the  CI,  in
            particular:

                  o  BUGCHK/BUGINF/Device-problem information to OPR
                  o  Password Encryption
                                                                        Page 9


                  o  HSC50 and RA81
                  o  CI20 support
                  o QUEUE% JSYS support





        4.0  TOPS-20 V6.0 SOFTWARE PACKAGE

             The TOPS-20 V60 package  is  a  normal  distribution  kit
        except for the inclusion of a documentation tape.

        All sites receive the following:
        1.  Cover Letter
        2.  Software Product Description (SPD) in letter form
        3.  Printed copies of the TOPS-20.BWR (beware) and TOPS-20.DOC
            files
        4.  Installation Tape
        5.  Distribution Tape
        6.  Floppy Disks for RSX20F and microcode
        7.  TOPS-20 V6.0 Documentation Tape

        In addition, TOPS-20AN (QT031) customers receive:
        1.  A TCP/IP Binary tape

        For Source Sites, the package includes one or more  (depending
        on licenses) of the following source media:
        1.  TOPS-20 Source Tape
        2.  EXEC Source Tape
        3.  TCP/IP Source Tape (QT031 and TOPS-20 Source License)
        4.  RSX20F Source Disk

        The TOPS-20 V6.0 software package contains the  same  software
        shipped with V5.1 except for the following:

        1.  Components updated as part of V6.0 development.

        2.  Components  updated   as   part   of   V5.1   maintenance.
            Autopatched  components are at the same level as Autopatch
            Tape 8.

        The TOPS-20.BWR (beware) file indicates those components which
        have  not  been  updated and which are not Autopatched.  Since
        sites may have local edits in  this  software,  customers  are
        advised  (in  the cover letter) to read the beware file before
        superceding anything on their system.
                                                                       Page 10


        5.0  SYSTEM PERFORMANCE INFORMATION

             TOPS-20 V6.0 is larger than V5.1 and  some  of  the  code
        paths,  especially for I/O, are longer in order to accommodate
        CI disks and to provide a base for Common File System support.
        Customers should anticipate a performance degradation of up to
        %12 on the same physical configuration.  While Digital expects
        that this degradation will be less in most environments, it is
        difficult to be  more  definitive.   CI20  performance  for  a
        single  user  is roughly equivalent to an RP06.  When multiple
        users  are  accessing  HSC50  disks,  the   total   throughput
        approaches RP07 speed.

             TOPS-20 V6.0 makes greater use of  the  MCA25  than  does
        5.1.  In most environments, V6.0 will perform better on a 2065
        (with MCA25) than 5.1 does on a 2060  (no  MCA25)  where  both

A.1  INTRODUCTION

This document describes the work performed in Release 6 in order to  make  the
monitor  "fit"  into  its  available  virtual  address  space.   Unlike the CI
projects, this project does not provide new facilities to the user,  nor  does
it  involve  the  creation  of  new modules.  Rather, it consists primarily of
changes to existing code.



A.2  STRATEGY

When the monitor conversion to extended addressing was begun, sections 0 and 1
(both  code  and  data) were mapped together.  Little by little, code has been
changed, and new code has been written, to  obey  the  rules  for  running  in
extended  sections.   Such  code  was  therefore able to reference data in any
section, and some data (the DST, directories,  etc.)  had  been  moved  before
TOPS-20 V6.0.  All code continued to run in sections 0 or 1.


The following sections provide a brief description of the changes made in V6.



A.2.1  Movement Of Data To Extended Sections

A.2.1.1  Static Data -


Three new macros (RSE,  NRE,  and  NRPE)  allow  the  assignment  of  extended
addresses  to  resident  and swappable data locations.  The related new PSECTs
(ERVAR, ENVAR, and EPVAR) are assigned to an extended section by statements in
STG  (or PARAMS).  EDEFST and EMSKST provide the extended equivalent of DEFSTR
and MSKSTR.



A.2.1.2  Dynamic Data -


A new routine, ASGVAS, provides for dynamic allocation of space in an extended
section.  This is used for creating a section map for SCA.

CST0, CST1, CST2, and CST3 have been moved to an extended section.  Space  for
these tables is allocated at system startup.


Resident free space can be allocated from an extended section  if  the  caller
requests  it.   The  following  list  contains  each new user of extended free
space:

        Terminal data
        Timer data
        NSP data

In addition, new code written for SCA  and  CFS  uses  extended  section  free
space.


Swappable free space can also be allocated from an extended section.   ENQ/DEQ
and IPCF use this.



A.2.1.3  Other Data -


DDT's symbol table no longer lives in a separate map, but is allocated  in  an
extended section.


The descriptions of BUGINFs, BUGCHKs, and BUGHLTs are moved into  an  extended
section at system startup.



A.2.2  Movement Of Code

We have taken a first step toward allowing code in sections other than  0  and
1.


Executive DDT and MDDT now run in their own section.


                                     NOTE

               Caution, users executing jsys's in MDDT will use
               a global stack pointer and may crash the system,
               if the jsys isn't prepared for it.

A.2.3  Isolation Of Section 0 Code

As more data has been moved out of the  code  sections,  more  code  has  been
converted  to  run in section 1.  The style of some code makes such conversion
difficult, however.


Since code running in section 0 cannot reference data in extended sections, we
have  needed  to  protect ourselves against accidentally running in section 0.
And since this case is not readily detected, we have decided  to  remove  code
from  the  section 0 map wherever possible.  Thus v6.0 is the first release in
which sections 0 and 1 are mapped separately.


Resident code that can run in section 1 is allocated to the RSCOD  PSECT.   It
and  all  swappable code exist only in section 1.  Resident code that must run
in section 0 is allocated to the SZCOD PSECT  and  mapped  to  both  sections.
This  allows  us to call it from section 1, and to convert it gradually to run
in section 1.



A.3  EFFECTS

A.3.1  Configurations

Many data structures whose size varied according to the configuration have now
been  moved  to  extended sections.  Thus we will no longer be able to squeeze
some extra space by reducing configurations.  Each time we need more space, we
will have to move new data or code, and test the effects.



A.3.2  Performance

At a minimum, referencing data outside of the code section requires an indexed
or  indirect reference.  Worse, some changes have led us to the use of OWGBPs.
It seems likely, too, that we have increased the frequency of pager conflicts.
All of these will have a negative effect on performance.



A.3.3  Changes To Monitor Build Procedures

Because of the limitations of LINK, the PSECTS that exist in extended sections
are  created  in a nonstandard way.  This has caused changes to the procedures
for building monitors.
