1.0  NEW FUNCTIONALITY

The following new functions have been added to BOOT:

     1.  Subdirectory handling.   BOOT  will  now  load/dump
         from/to a subdirectory.

     2.  Dual-port  unlocking.    Previously,   BOOT   would
         unconditionally  grab a dual-ported RP04567 and not
         release it until the load or  dump  was  completed.
         Now,  it  is more polite, locking and unlocking the
         port for each  IO  transaction.   This  allows  the
         other  system to access the device when the port is
         unlocked.  In particular, one can now  interrupt  a
         load  or  dump  in  progress with ^\ and get to the
         RSX20F parser.   A  single  ^\  is  sufficient  (it
         requires  about  2-4  seconds to receive the parser
         prompt).

     3.  Single-pass loading.   BOOT  will  perform  only  a
         single  pass  to  load release 6 monitors.  It will
         still  perform  a  2-pass  load  on  pre-release  6
         monitors.

     4.  Long-file handling.  BOOT can now  load  a  monitor
         containing more than 512 pages.
