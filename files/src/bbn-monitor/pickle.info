Description: To Tickle, Gather and File IP Status Reports

PICKLE is an internet protocol tickler and statusgram logger.
It runs as a user program and requires NETWIZ capability.

The send-tickle (S) command prompts for a host address, which
may be typed as an octal number, four decimal bytes separated
by ".", or a text name.  A terminator alone defaults to the
previous ticklee.  The tickle has 4 octets of data: 16 bits of
local port (source of tickle), and 16 bits of foreign port
(destination of tickle).  The ticklee is expected to return a
statusgram, an IP packet reporting its status, which TICKLE logs.

The receive (R) command puts TICKLE into a spooling mode,
primarily intended for unattended monitoring operation.
Received statusgrams are logged to appropriate files.

The verbose (V) command toggles whether text information
indexing the log files is printed on the terminal or not.
The default is not to print it.  It is always written into
index files, however.

The exit (E) command leaves PICKLE gracefully, after allowing
any logging in progress to complete and halting the inferior
process.

The inferior process executes a loop: read an IP message,
process it, loop.  If the reception (RCVIN) is in error, the
packet is ignored.  If the packet is an ICMP message, TICKLE
prints a warning on the terminal, such as:
	Received ICMP message from host BBNA,
	    type 3 (dest unreachable), code 2
and does not further process the ICMP message.
Otherwise, TICKLE appends the packet, including the RCVIN
argument-and-return-value word containing the word count,
to a file.  The file name is host.bin, where "host" is the
text name of the packet's source, such as BBNA.BIN.  If no
text name is available, TICKLE uses the four decimal bytes
punctuated with "-", such as 3-3-0-5.BIN.
Then TICKLE constructs a text string describing the index
information for the packet it has just logged.  This string
has the date and time from the packet, the source host system
up time from the packet, the sequence number (segment ID),
the decimal value of the host.bin file pointer at the start of
the new entry, the length of the entry in words,
and the source host (as text or as four decimal bytes
punctuated with ".").  This string is appended to the file
host.index, where "host" is the same as with the host.bin file.
If verbose mode has been enabled (see V command, above), the
string is also printed on the terminal.  A header line,
listing the various fields of the index text string, is printed
each time the verbose (V) command is serviced; this is an easy
way to obtain a run-time printout of the field meanings.
The inferior then returns to awaiting another packet.

When the first receive (R) or send (S) command is serviced,
the inferior fork is started.  Also at this time the ASNIQ,
to assign an internet queue, is executed.  Some parameters of
the ASNIQ vary depending on whether the command needing the
ASNIQ is an R or an S, that is, which is serviced first.
The difference in parameters creates two modes of operation.
R first creates "monitor mode", where TICKLE logs all
statusgrams initiated by foreign sites.  S first creates
"manual mode", where TICKLE logs only responses to tickles
initiated by the user of this instance of TICKLE.  A single
host may run one TICKLE in monitor mode and one or more TICKLEs
in manual mode, all simultaneously.  The varying parameters are:
mode		local port value	local port mask (octal)
----		----------------	-----------------------
monitor (R)	LOCPOR (= 240.)		177777
manual (S)	job#,0 (1 octet each)	177400
The job number is also used in the segment ID field of each
tickle; the high octet is the job number, and the low octet is
a count starting at 1 and incrementing for each tickle sent.


Example: (of manual mode)
