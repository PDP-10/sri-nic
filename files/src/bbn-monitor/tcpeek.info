Description: To peek at TCP in operation

TCPEEK is run by a user to examine statistics of the TCP and IP
running on the same machine.  WHEEL capability is needed.
TCPEEK uses the JSYS SNOOP to obtain the value of various canned
symbols in the running monitor.  It uses these values to determine
what monitor pages contain the statistics of interest, and maps
these into an area called WINDOW in its own address space.
TCPEEK then enters the main loop, where it accepts a command and
dispatches to service it.

When the take-a-snapshot command (right angle bracket, >)
is given, TCPEEK makes a copy (using BLT) of the contents of
WINDOW in the area called SNAP, and computes the amount each word
changed from its value at the previous snapshot, storing the change
in the area called DELTA.  The take-a-snapshot command also prints
some data from the snapshot.  A header line contains the local
host name, snapshot number, and time of day.  Then RFNTAB entries
of interest (see set-RFNTST command, below) are printed.  Then
message counts from .NCT0 and .NCT1 (each only if the symbol is
defined) are printed.  For each of these, the count and change
from previous snapshot are printed, followed by a text string for
the message type or subtype, followed by the numeric type and
subtype.  If the count for a type or subtype is zero, that line
is not printed.  After printing NCT tables, GWTAB is scanned for
any gateways which have gone up or down since the previous snapshot.
For each which has, its address and present status are printed.
TCPEEK initially thinks all gateways are down, so snapshot 1 will
report all gateways which are up.

The print-status-of-a-symbol command (slash, /)
prompts the user for a text string, evaluates that string using
the JSYS STAT, and prints the value of that location in the
latest snapshot (and its change, found in DELTA).  The symbol
may be a vector (such as a histogram), for which each element
is printed.  If the user types no symbol argument, the command
is executed as if the symbol in the previous execution of this
command had been typed.  That symbol is printed as a reminder.

The symbol typed by the user may be followed by "+" and a decimal
number, which is used as an offset (in words) to the value found
for the symbol.  The next-entry command (N) adds one to this
offset and then executes as if the previous symbol had been typed
to the print-status-of-symbol command with the new offset value.
This makes scanning through consecutive single word statistics
easier.

After the symbol name, and word offset (if any), the user may
type a comma and a limit on the number of entries to print.
This argument, if present, overrides the vector length returned by
STAT.  The result is reduced by the offset argument (if any),
to prevent printing beyond the meaningful end of the vector.
The user's optional limit, and the reduction by the offset, apply
only to "free format" printout and not to the special formats
described below.

The user may terminate the print-status-of-symbol command with
special characters to specify printing in special formats.
The special characters / and \ specify printing as a
two-dimensional vector (such as count of message types, with some
ypes broken down into subtypes), optionally (\) with text (ARPANET
type and subtype) annotation.  The special character | specifies
printing as a histogram with bin limits defined by values in the
histogram area itself.  This format shows the second header word
(the first is the number of bins), followed by one line per bin,
each line showing the snapshot value, the change since the previous
snapshot, and the bin definition value.  In the special formats
specified by terminator / or \ or |, the first two words of the
area in memory are header words; thus, use of the offset option
together with these formats will execute, but will probably
produce unexpected results, because the print routine will interpret
data words as header words.

In summary, the print-status-of-symbol command looks like this:
	/symbol[+offset][,limit][/ or \ or |]
where optional arguments are shown [thus].  Not all possible
combinations of arguments are useful; the useful combinations are:
   /symbol		prints contents of location or vector
			(command terminated by CR, LF, ESC, or space)
   /symbol+offset	"offset" is added to value of symbol
			before lookup is performed
   /symbol,limit	only "limit" number of entries are printed
   /symbol+offset,limit	printing begins at "offset" words
			into the vector, and ends after "limit" words
			into the vector; "limit" - "offset" words
			are printed
   /symbol/		print as 2-D vector
   /symbol\		print as 2-D vector with ARPANET annotation
   /symbol|		print as value-defined histogram

The print-guide command (G) prints the text, evaluation, offset in
SNAP and DELTA areas, length of the data in words, and number of
separate areas of memory needed.  The last three of these are
printed only if relevant (e.g., a symbol which is the length of a
table has no corresponding area of memory).  The last entry is
greater than 1 for a symbol such as GWTAB (gateway table), a table
of tables, so each component table incurs a distinct need for an
area or "block" of memory.  The guide printout can help in looking
at statistics in SNAP or DELTA with a debugger, if normal TCPEEK
mechanisms are not adequate for a particular task.

The print-route command (R) prompts the user for an address
(in any of three formats: octal, four decimal bytes separated by ".",
or text name), scans NETHTB (net host table) for matching entries
(there should be at most one, but all are found), prints the
corresponding route found in the parallel entry in NETGWY (net
gateway table), and the prior route if it was different and
non-zero.  If the NETGWY entry shows routing to a local net
interface (rather than a gateway), the interface number is printed.

The set-RFNTST command (S) prompts the user for an address in
any of three formats, and stores this as the value to be matched
when printing out RFNTAB entries.  Entries are printed which
match RFNTST exactly, or which are non-zero if RFNTST is zero.
Thus setting RFNTST to zero causes all non-zero entries to print.
The initial value of RFNTST is the user's own host, which normally
matches no entries.  Printing is performed after each snapshot, and
after each set-RFNTST command.  Typing no new value defaults to the
current value of RFNTST, an easy way to repeat the latest printing.
In detail, if the low 32 bits of RFNTAB entry n is "of interest"
(as above), TCPEEK prints "RFNTAB+n/", the RFNM count field in the
top 4 bits of the RFNTAB entry (in decimal), "RFN8TO+n/", and the
contents of the parallel entry in that table (in octal).

The TCB print command (tilde, ~)
prompts the user for a TCB ID and a monitor address, maps some
monitor memory at that address into TCPEEK, and checks that the
TCB ID therein is the same as that the user typed.  Then the
text name, and current value as seen through this window, of
several locations within a TCB are printed.  Values printed are
decimal, except those preceded by # are octal.  Once this command
has been executed, the normal print-status-of-a-symbol command
can be used to examine these or other TCB locations in the
windowed TCB.
Typing escape (ESC) defaults the TCB ID or the monitor
address to the previous value used by the TCB print command.
When the TCB print command is invoked, two lines of trace
information are printed, showing arguments to the JSYS GTMPG,
which maps the monitor pages into the window.  These are useful
for debugging if errors occur.  Similar trace information is printed
when TCPEEK execution begins, and when the exit command is invoked.

The exit command (E) exits.  Whenever TCPEEK does a GTMPG JSYS,
the arguments are printed before the monitor page is mapped in.
This occurs during initial startup, and during the exit command.
The GTMPG arguments are useful in debugging TCPEEK problems,
and provide an indication that the mapping of monitor pages
is proceeding.

If a letter (A-Z, a-z) is typed which is not recognized as a command,
TCPEEK assumes the user may have wanted the print-status-of-symbol
command, and prints the appropriate command character and prompt,
re-echoes the user's typein, and enters the print-status-of-symbol
command service routine.  The user may continue typing the symbol,
or may abort this with any non-symbol-or-terminator, such as rubout.
