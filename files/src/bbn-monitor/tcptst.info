   The TCPTST program exercises TCP connections by acting as a
data SINK, an ECHOer, or a data SOURCE (and SINK).  It is an
example of using the BBN TCP JSYSi documented in TCP-IP.DOC.
About half of the program is related to command processing
using the COMND JSYS.  It is intended to be self-documenting
through use of "?", <esc>, and the HELP command/sub-commands.
A sample of its use to create a data sink and then source data
to the sink is shown on the next page.  Lines beginning with ">"
are information lines reporting status and events about the
current processes.

   The *chECK (RECEIVED DATA OF TYPE) bINARY line requests that
the (binary) data received be checked (it is assumed that the
data generator will be the SOURCE process).

   The *siNK (RECEIVED DATA) line creates a listening connection.
The >SINK   Listening (0.0.0.0 14.1) ... response indicates a
default port of 14.1 (14 is the job number).

  The following *stATUS command lists the status of current
connections - the sink process in this case.  It shows the
connection is waiting for the OPEN to complete, etc.

   The *soURCE (DATA OF TYPE) bINARY /a:bbnf 14 1 /c:50000
command creates a data source and opens an active connection to
BBNF port 14.1 (the previously created SINK).  The two processes
then respond that the connetion has been opened.

   The STATUS command is then used to examine the state of the
two processes - what they are waiting for, now much data has
been exchanged, whether any errors were detected, how much data
remains to be sent before the connection is closed, etc.

   When all the data has been sent, the connection is closed and
each process gives a summary.

   Finally, the EXIT command is used to return to the TOPS20 EXEC.
