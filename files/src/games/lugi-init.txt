You are inside a small cylindrical metal cage, one of many along one wall of a_
huge room.  The only features inside are a small metal shelf and a red button._
The room is crowded with hundreds of Lugimen, most of them dressed in gaudy_
uniforms and heavily armed.  The heavy gravity and noisome atmosphere tell you_
that you are no longer on Earth, but on Arcturus IV, the home planet of the_
Lugimen.  At the opposite end of the room, surrounded by servile Lugimen and_
brutal-looking guards, a monstrous bloated horror sits in a heavy gilded chair._
You realize that the monstrosity is none other than the Grugza Emperor Ra-Lugi_
himself, the absolute ruler of the planet, in his own throne room!  Suddenly,_
the Emperor's small, feral eyes meet yours, and he gives a bestial scream of_
rage!  His guards leap forward, drawing their weapons!  Things look bad..._
\You're standing in a small metal cage in the throne room of the Emperor_
Ra-Lugi.  Thick brown fog makes it impossible to see a thing.  You hear_
screams of Lugonian rage from the Emperor's guards, who cannot see to shoot_
you.  You can feel a small shelf and a button in the cage._
\You're stumbling around in opaque brown fog.  You can't see a thing._
\You're in a hot, smoky room choked with the ashes of man-eating plants._
\You are in a bloodstained bunker.  Several skulls are scattered about._
There is a small iron door in one corner._
\You're in the ghost room.  Every exit is open.  There is no iron door._
\You're in an ornate Louis XVI type bathroom.  It is sparkling clean._
\You are standing amid the wrecked remains of a NASA centrifuge._
\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#
\You are on a sunny balcony over a busy street._
\You're in a long green corridor with seeps of slimy water oozing_
down the walls._
\You're in a green room devoid of features._
\You're in a domed hall filled with sooty, sulphurous smoke._
\You're in an ornate but smelly bathroom.  Phew!_
\You're in a library, with two dusty books._
\You're in a plain white cubicle._
\You are in a bloodstained bunker.  Several skulls are scattered about._
\You're in a dingy white cubicle, with a cabinet at the far end._
\You are in a brown study._
\You're in a sunny alcove under a bright skylight._
\You're in a humming, buzzing control room, with many switches and buttons._
\You're in a bare room with a three foot high empty niche in one wall._
There is a faint odor of foul chemicals._
\You're in the rat room.  Millions of hungry rats swarm over you!_
\You're waist deep in a pile of dirty laundry, in a filthy washroom._
\You're in a cubicle, numbered 356._
\You're in the most cluttered office you have ever seen!  Piles of newspapers_
lie everywhere._
\You're walking through an empty cafeteria.  Gnawed bones (type unknown) lie_
everywhere._
\You are in a two foot bird cage, apparently made of bakelite._
\You are in the stomach of a stuffed shark, part of a museum exhibit._
\You're in an operating room.  The room has not been cleaned for the_
last three (or perhaps thirty) operations._
\You're in a giant soggy cardboard box._
\You're in a grimy new-car showroom with a huge glass window, luridly painted_
on the outside, looking out onto a busy street.  You see that you are nearly_
two miles from the Embassy. _
There is one dust-coated car here, a model made eight years ago._
\You're waist-deep in a pool of clear water, in a rock-lined cistern._
\You are looking down over a vast-- no, an endless sea of shifting_
gray nothingness, a nothingness so absolute that you cannot bear to_
look at it, for you feel that you will go mad.  In the great distance,_
shrouded by mist and haze, are many huge forms, like gigantic statues,_
with shapes that, even at this distance, appear hideous and malformed._
A sign on the wall reads "Chew Zqrgley's gum!"_
\You're in the joke room.  There are many cloth gags here, and a funny smell._
\You are in the ghost room!  A deathly cold voice cries out,_
        "You are trapped!  None of your foolish devices will work here!_
         You will stay here until you beg for help!"_
The only exit is a small iron door in one corner._
\You are in a transparent bubble floating high in the air.  The city is spread_
out beneath you, and you see a large crowd gathered in front of the Lugonian_
embassy, which is directly beneath you.  For just a moment, on the balcony_
above the crowd, you seem to see a strange shadowy shape moving about, but_
then it is gone.  A sign on the wall of the bubble reads "No spitting."_
\You're walking over a hill of pills and capsules.  You hear the_
sounds of small burrowing vermin.  There is a lot of dirt thrown_
about.  It is dark, and the roof is to high above to see._
\You're inside a four-foot polished iron cube._
\You're walking on an ornately carved floor.  There is a lot of antique_
furniture on the ceiling.  There are upside-down paintings on the walls._
\You are in a strange room with glass walls and a sloping floor, shaped_
roughly like a round-cornered pyramid tilted on it's side.  The floor_
and walls converge to a narrow tube behind you, from which protrudes a complex_
set of metal wires and plates.  The forward wall, which forms the base of the_
pyramid, is transparent.  Looking out, you see an enormous living-room with a_
carpeted floor ten feet below.  A magnified suburban family (Junior is_
eighteen feet tall) is staring at you with bland, idiotic expressions.  They_
seem unaware of your motions and signals, though their eyes follow you._
\You're in a large room full of exposed circuitry.  The parts are unfamiliar._
\You're in an airlock.  A sign says, "No farting."_
\You're in a dirty hole.  Dozens of lizards are busily filling out forms._
\You are in a large bare chamber holding a huge NASA astronaut centrifuge._
\You're in a large, perfectly spherical chamber with a complex device_
floating in the exact center._
\You're in a polished steel tank with an inch of water in it._
\You're in a grisly chamber with whips, chains, tongs, an iron maiden_
with a skeleton in it, and a large drainpipe in the middle of the_
floor.  There is a CIA badge on the table, next to a large hibachi._
\You're in a pitch dark closet-sized room-- you can't see what's_
around you.  You gag on thick kerosene vapor._
\You're in an air vent looking down over the Lugonian mess hall, where_
thousands of the fiends are eating a disgusting lunch._
_
You'd better get out QUICK, or they'll spot you!_
\You're in the great central control room.  There are chairs, consoles with_
buttons and switches, and a huge viewing screen.  It is deserted._
\You are in the bowels of a huge machine.  Gigantic shafts and levers_
grind madly, generating the most umbearable noise you have ever_
experienced.  Great masses of metal are shrieking and roaring,_
seemingly crying out in an uncontrollable rage.  Huge chunks of steel_
swoop near your head, and, involuntarily, you cower to the floor.  Hot_
oil is spurting everywhere, and, as you watch, a Lugiman in greasy_
coveralls trundles a huge drum of the stuff up onto a catwalk, and_
pours it into a hopper on the top of the machine. Finishing the_
operation, he goes back down for another drum.  The walls of the room,_
and the flanks of the monstrous device itself, are plastered with_
safety warning signs.  Paths are marked out on the floor in orange_
paint.  The nearest one is many yards away.  You suddenly realise it is_
tremendously hot-- the noise had wiped out all other sensation for the_
last minute.  If you don't get out soon, you fear you may be deafened._
\You're in a garden of dry brown man-eating plants.  The air is extremely dry._
\You're in an indoor drydock, which holds an enormous French battleship._
\You're in a large, airy chamber.  At least a dozen two foot birds wheel_
and soar near the ceiling, screeching happily.  Apparently this freedom is_
a rare treat for them._
\You're in a small room with several barrels of black tar-like stuff._
Written on each barrel is "ghuzza Zqrgley'u thez"._
\You're in the Imperial Intelligence central data archive.  All of the data_
is stored in a gigantic transparent crystal, sealed in a vacuum chamber._
\You're in a narrow corridor with thin wood paneled walls.  Strange animal_
sounds come through the right hand wall.  In that same wall is a small hole,_
big enough to peek through._
\You are in a men's room.  The toilets and urinals are clogged with dust._
There is something printed on the wall, in Lugonian._
\You are in a chamber containing...  stuffed agents.  Some have toothmarks,_
disguised with heavy pancake makeup.  You are sickened._
\You are in a lobby, apparently in the center of a long multi-story building_
made of brownish concrete and red-colored steel.  Balcony walkways surround_
the floor, apparently connecting office doors.  The roof is made of small_
trapezoidal glass windows, and there are an elevator and a staircase at each_
end of the lobby.  The floor is on two levels, and has red carpeting.  There_
is a machine like several orange refrigerators behind a window on the left._
At one end, a bunch of odd little gnomes hunch over strange boxes with glowing_
words on the front, uttering strange quiet noises.  At the opposite end are a_
bunch of blue foam-stuffed chairs and round white tables._
\You are in the middle of a peaceful meadow.  God knows how you got here._
\You're in a cave, and I smell a wumpus._
\You're in a round room whose floor continuously rotates at about 6 RPM._
\You're in a round, bare room with a flat black metal floor.  A brilliant_
point of light, brighter than the sun, dazzles your eyes from high above,_
illuminating the empty area._
\You're in a room that's...  well, it's indescribable._
\You're in a vast haze-filled recreation hall.  Complex and massive_
looking machines tower in all directions with odd-looking controllers_
protruding from all sides, as if pinball devices were designed for_
intelligent octopi._
\You're in a small room with a large "X" painted on one wall._
\You're in a small room with a large "Y" painted on one wall._
\You're in a wax-museum replica of a WWI army recruitment office._
\You're in the embassy's main meat locker.  No meat is actually here, though_
the place looks well used.  It's stiflingly hot, because a smoky fire burns in_
a cast-iron stove._
\You're in a medium sized room with moist air and a dirt floor.  Dim sunlight_
comes in through a small, dirty, barred window near the ceiling.  There are_
indications that an experienced explorer, possibly the great I. M. FisK,_
has been here recently._
\You're in a disk-shaped room sixty feet in diameter and four feet tall._
\You are inside a giant walk-through plastic model of a pancreas cell._
\You are standing in an enormous room, hundreds of yards square, among rows of_
immense transparent columns filled with clear liquid.  Many bubbles, large and_
small, move up through the fluid to the towering tops of the columns, which_
pass through the ceiling to God knows where._
\You are inside a cube with mirrored sides.  You see thousands of reflections_
of yourself in every direction._
\You are in the ARF room.  Painted on the wall is:_
_
           @      @@@@@@    @@@@@@@   !!_
          @ @     @     @   @         !!_

\You are in a dusty, cobwebby, old store, called "Mort's Bagels"._
\You are in a large square room, brightly lit.  The floor is a mosaic showing_
the growth of this pattern_
_
                    **_

                            according to the rules of John Horton Conway's_
"life" game, through one thousand generations._
\You're sitting in a pile of fluffy cloth.  A small voice says, "I strongly_
recommend the fiction of Alfred Bester."_
\You're in the Hall of the Mountain King.  Anyway, that's what it looks like._
\You are in a little brick house in the middle of the woods._
\You are standing under a street light on a foggy night.  Somehow, you are_
wearing a trench coat and a hat._
\You are walking down a long tube, whose walls are a brightly glowing white_
waxy substance.  The diameter is about five feet, so you must stoop._
\You are inside a curving concrete pipe, eight feet in diameter._
\_
_
        Pay attention, 'cause I'm only gonna say this once._
_
You are a CIA agent charged with exploring the Lugonian embassy.  Odd things_
have occured there, including the possibility that the Lugimen (who are from_
Arcturus IV and resemble trolls) have eaten several people, including (we_
believe) some of the agents we've sent into the building.  Your mission,_
should you choose to accept it, is to go in, explore as much of the building_
as you can, and escape alive, bringing any alien-looking objects you find out_
with you.  The only known opening is a balcony high above the street._
_
The last agent to get out swears that the Lugimen use teleportation like we_
use telephones.  He was constantly vanishing in one place and appearing in_
another, as were many of the objects he found.  Also, the Lugimen rearrange_
the floor plan of the building unbelieveably often, though the number of_
rooms in the building remains constant at #._
_
_
_
_
_
_
_
To move about in the building, type one of the commands_
_
    North, South, East, West, Jump, Climb, Forward, Backward_
_
..."jump" means go down, "climb" means go up, "forward" means go the direction_
you just went again, "backward" means go back the direction you just came._
You may say "n", "s", "e", "w", "j", "c", "f", or "b" instead.  There are also_
words like "procede", "upward", "descend", etc. that are synonyms to some of_
those commands.  Parts of the building twist oddly, so scribble a map as you_
move about or you will get lost._
_
To pick up any objects you find, say_
_
    Take <object> <object> <object>... ,_
    Carry The <object> And Also The <object> And... ,_
    Get All, Pick It Up, ....  (or anything of that sort.)_
_
To take an object that is inside a container, say_
_
    Take Out <object> <object>... , Get Out It, etc._
    (Warning: "take <object> out" won't work.)_
_
_
_
_
_
To handle objects you have, you can say_
_
    Drop <object>, Open <object>, Eat <object>, Throw <object>, etc. or_
    Put <object> <object> <object> ... In <container>, or_
    Put Down <object> <object> <object>..._
_
Examples: "take the match", "put down hammer and skull", "put all in cabinet",_
"open it up", "pick everything up", "throw it", "pour water", "ignite it"._
_
Other useful commands include "read", "enter", "leave", "help", and "attack"._
The "inv" (or "inventory") command will tell you what objects you have.  The_
"out" or "leave" command will get you out of the building, if you have access_
to the outside._
_
Note:  try to collect gleeps.  These are small, featureless, unpredictable_
objects that appear and disappear at random._
_
_
_
_
_
 _
_
_
_
_
The word "r" makes the rest of the line you type in a comment.  This is useful_
in Photo or in a talk link._
_
Remember: any word can be abbreviated to five or more letters, although_
every letter you type is significant.  Thus, "sandw" means "sandwich", but_
"sandwater" does not.  Another note: all special characters, like punctuation,_
get treated as spaces.  How's that for cheapo?_
_
You will be asked to select a short, medium, or long time period.  Using a_
shorter one is more valuable but increases risk.  But first, remember that_
this is a volunteer mission..._

There is a coil of rope

YYYYOOOOWWW!!!  It's red hot!
They crumble at a touch.  You'll have to read them here.
They're mounted like telephone books.  You'll have to read them here.
You can't take it for some reason.
<< badge is deadly >>
Everything is nailed in place.  (It would fall down otherwise.)
I'm afraid it's gonna stay right where it is for now...
You're joking-- it must weigh as much as a full grown Lugiman! 
It gives you a powerful electric shock!
The little vermin are too fast for you.
It's epoxied in place.  Next time, bring a chisel.
They easily evade you.
It's put together like a brick wall, in typical Lugonian fashion.
He's is kinda small, but he still weighs four hundred pounds.
He's a runt, but he still weighs three hundred pounds.
You're not going to get it very far without starting it.
If you try taking them, they'll eat you.
If you can get a solid grip on him, you're a better man than I am.
I thought you asked to take it... I must be getting deaf.
You can't take it for some reason.
A sudden feeling of sadness prevents you from disturbing them.
It's just too clumsy to carry around.
They're too fast for you.
The joke's on you!  You can't have one.
They never come down where you can reach.
It's is too sticky to carry outside it's 300 pound barrel.
The remains are nailed to their pedestals.
<< wumpus does not exist >>
<< bagels do not exist >>
They are attached to their tabletops with plastic-coated steel cables.
The feeble creature clings unbreakably, with mad strength, to it's box.
TAKE it!?!   Ho Ho Ho Ha Ha Ha Ha Ho Ho...!  Jeez, you kill me!
These Lugonian ones dodge much better than Earth flies.
It's too heavy to lift.  Just let it follow you.
You scratch at it, and can't separate more than a few teeny flakes.
You can't enter the vacuum chamber, and only a moron would really try.
You can't take it for the simple reason that it weighs 14 tons.
