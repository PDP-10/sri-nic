                              BACKGROUND


	The  program  on  SRI was written by Richard Greenblatt  at MIT
about 1965  (in a  weekend) and improved  over the  next several years.
It is  named MAC-HACK  and has  achieved  a class-C tournament ranking.

        It is a  classical heuristic search program.   When considering
what move to  make, the program  considers plausible first  moves, then
plausible responses to  each of those,  and plausible next  moves after
each response, and so on.   Because there are about 10  possibile moves
open to each player (on the  average) each turn and there are  about 60
turns for each  player in an  average game, there  are about 10  to the
120th power possible move sequences the program would have  to consider
if it exhaustively searched this space of moves, responses, next moves,
etc.  Therefore,  the program selects  a small number  (W) of  the best
moves to consider at each level, and then only explores  sequences that
are a  few levels (D)  deep.  If W  and D are  very small,  the program
plays like a rank beginner.  If W and D are very large, the  program is
very slow.  (You have control over these -- more on that later.)


        Another essential  characteristic of heuristic  search programs
is the evaluation function  (alluded to above) that allows  the program
to  choose  the  "best"  possibilities.   In  this  program  moves  are
evaluated by considering such things as (a) center control -- does this
move, directly or eventually (after D levels), help the program (or the
opponent) control the center  better (b) material balance --  does this
move, directly or  eventually, allow the  program (or the  opponent) to
capture a piece (c) mobility -- does this move, directly or eventually,
free up, or block, avenues open to other pieces.

                        HOW TO RUN THE PROGRAM


        1. After login type <GAMES>CHESS


        2. The prompt for  your input is a left-arrow  (or underscore).
First tell the program which color to play.
     PB      (play black)
     PW      (play white)
     PS      (play self -- if you want to watch only)
     PN      (play neither -- if you want to play both sides yourself)


        3. Moves are  designated in  the American notation,  e.g., P-K4
means  move  the king-pawn  to  king-four.  The  program  is reasonably
tolerant of  variations and  will tell you  when your  specification is
ambiguous.  When this happens,  retype your move but be  more specific,
for example, N-B3 would be ambiguous at the start of a game  and should
be specified as one of the following: QN-B3 , N-QB3 , N/QN1-B3  for the
queen-knight to QB3.  The  slash in the third specification  stands for
"at" -- the hyphen stands for "to".


        4. You may type any command when you see the prompt  for input,
or type a move.  Available commands are:
     BD    (print a picture of the current board)
     PG    (print the sequence of moves up to now)
     U     (take away one move by one player -- this is a little
            tricky (as well as sneaky) because you must
            tell the program which side to play (PB or PW)
            after you have undone moves.  You may type U as many
            times as you want -- each folowed by a carriage
            return -- to undo moves back to the point where you
            got yourself in trouble.  Then type PB or PW.)

     RESET  (to reset the game to the beginning -- you must
            type PB or PW again after resetting)

     SETW=  (to find out the number of plausible moves (W) the
            program is currently considering at each level)

     SETD=  (to find out the number of levels deep (D) the program
            is searching in order to look for the best next move)

     SETW n  (to set the width -- this is a little tricky
             because you can type   SETW 12 10 7
             to set the width at 12 for the first level, 10 for
             the second level, 7 for the third and successive
             levels.   SETW 6     causes the program to
             look at the best six moves at every level.

     SETD d  (to set the depth -- this takes only one number.)


        The  default  settings   are    SETW  6     SETD   4    .   For
tournament play  the program used    SETW 15 15  9 9    SETD  6     but
this wastes computer time and would make you impatient with the program
as well because it takes so long.  If the default settings are too easy
for you, the  following are almost as  good as the  tournament settings
and are much faster:   SETW 12 10 7    SETD 4


        You should know before you start that the depth is not  a rigid
limit.  If the program  and opponent are in  the middle of a  series of
exchanges when the depth level is reached, the program will consider as
many more levels as it needs to decide on the outcome of the exchange.


        Good luck -- and remember that it is just a game.
