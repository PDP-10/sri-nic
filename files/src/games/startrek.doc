         ----------Introduction to the Game----------

The Organian peace treaty has collapsed, and the Federation
is  at war  with the Klingon  empire.  As  commander of the
starship U.  S. S. Enterprise, your mission  is to wipe out
the  Klingon invasion  fleet and  make the  galaxy safe for
democracy.

Your   battleground  is   the  entire   galaxy,  which  for
convenience  is  divided   up  into  eight  rows  of  eight
Quadrants each,  like a  checkerboard.  Rows  are  numbered
from top to bottom, and columns are numbered left to right,
so Quadrant  1 - 8 would be in  the upper right hand corner
of the galaxy.

During  battle  you  will  be  concerned  only  with  those
Klingons  that  occupy   the  same  Quadrant  as  yourself.
Quadrants are  divided up  into sectors;  ten rows  of  ten
sectors each.   Sectors are  numbered in  the same  way  as
Quadrants, so  the  sector in  the  upper right  corner  is
sector 1 - 10.  You have a short-range scanner which allows
you to look at the entire Quadrant in a single display.

Klingons recharge  during  your absence.   If you  leave  a
quadrant containing a  weakened Klingon, when you return to
that quadrant he will be strong again.  Also, each time you
enter  a  Quadrant,  the positions  of  everything  in  the
Quadrant (except your ship) are randomized, to save you the
trouble  of trying  to  remember  where everything  in  the
Quadrant is.  Notice that this refers only to the positions
of things  in the  Quadrant--the numbers  of each  kind  of
thing  are not  changed.  If  you kill  something, it stays
dead.

There  are two kinds of  Klingons; ordinary Klingons, which
are bad  enough,  and Klingon  Commanders, which  are  even
worse.  Commanders  are about  three  times  stronger  than
ordinary  Klingons. Commanders  are more  resistant to your
weapons.   Commanders can  move about  during battle, while
ordinary Klingons stay put.  And finally, Commanders have a
thing called  a "long-range  tractor beam"  which they  can
use,  at random intervals,  to yank you away  from what you
are doing and into their Quadrant, to do battle with them.

But the advantages are not all on the side of the Klingons.
Your  ship  is  more  powerful,  and  has  better  weapons.
Besides,  in  this  galaxy  there  are  from  two  to  four
Starbases,  at which you  can stop to refuel  and lick your
wounds,  safe from  attack or  tractor beams.   But you had
best  not dally there too  long, since time is  not on your
side.   The Klingons  are  not  just after  you!  They  are
attacking the entire  Federation.  There is always a finite
"time  left", which is  how much longer  the Federation can
hold out if you just sit on your fat behind and do nothing.
As you wipe out Klingons,  you reduce the rate at which the
invasion fleet  weakens the  Federation, and  so the  "time
left" until the Federation collapses may actually increase.
If you can get  all the Klingons, the Federation will abide
forever (well,  a while longer), and you win the game.


Space is vast, and it  takes precious time to move from one
place to another. The  different ways that time can pass is
when  you move, or  (at a relatively slow  rate) while real
time passes,  or when you issue a command  to sit still and
rest  for a period of  time. You will sometimes  want to do
the latter, since  the various devices aboard your starship
may be  damaged  and require  time  to repair.  Of  course,
repairs  can be made  more quickly at a  Starbase than they
can in flight.

In addition  to  Klingons and  Starbases, the  galaxy  also
contains  (surprise) stars.   Mostly, stars  are a nuisance
and  just get  in your  way.  You  can trigger  a star into
going nova by shooting  one of your Photon torpedoes at it.
When  a star  novas, it  does a  lot of  damage to anything
immediately adjacent to it.  If another star is adjacent to
a nova,  it too will go nova.   Stars may also occasionally
go supernova! A supernova in a Quadrant destroys everything
in   the  Quadrant  and  makes   the  Quadrant  permanently
uninhabitable.  You may "jump over" a Quadrant containing a
supernova when you move, but you should not stop there.

Supernovas  may happen  spontaneously, without provocation.
If a supernova occurs in the same quadrant you are in, your
starship has an  "emergency automatic override" which picks
some random  direction  and some  random warp  factor,  and
tries  to  throw  you  clear  of  the  supernova.   If  the
supernova  occurs in  some other  quadrant, you  just get a
warning  message  from Starfleet  about  it  (provided,  of
course, that your subspace radio is working).

Star  Trek   is  a  rich  game,   full  of  detail.   These
instructions  are written  at a  moderate level--no attempt
has been made fully  to describe everything about the game,
but  there is quite  a bit more  here than you  need to get
started.  If you are new to the game, just get a rough idea
of the  kinds  of commands  available, and  start  playing.
After  a game  or  two  you will  have  learned  everything
important,  and  the detailed  command  descriptions  which
follow will be a lot more meaningful to you.

You have weapons; Phasers and Photon torpedoes.  You have a
defense; Deflector Shields.   You can look at things; Long-
Range Scanners,  Short-Range Scanners,  a Computer,  and  a
Star  Chart. You  can  move  about, under  Warp  drive  and
Impulse power.  You can also dock at a Starbase, rest while
repairs are  being made,  abandon ship,  self destruct,  or
give up and start a new game.

The Klingons are waiting!


         ----------How to Issue Commands----------

When  the game is  waiting for  you to enter  a command, it
will print out
         COMMAND
You  may then  type  in  your  command.  All  you  have  to
remember for each command is the mnemonic.  For example, if
you want to move straight up for one quadrant, you can type
in the mnemonic
         MOVE
and the computer will prompt you with
         COURSE
Now you type in 12  (or 0) for the course, and the computer
responds with
         DISTANCE
So you type in 1 (one Quadrant).

When  you have  learned the  commands, you  can avoid being
prompted  by  simply  typing  in  the  information  without
waiting to  be asked  for it.   For example,  in the  above
example, you could simply type in
         MOVE 12 1
and it will be done.  Or you could type in
         MOVE
and when the computer responds with
         COURSE
you can type in
         12 1
and it  will  understand  that the  course  is 12  and  the
distance is 1.

You can abbreviate most mnemonics.  For "move", you can use
any of
         MOVE     MOV     MO     M
successfully.   For your safety,  certain critical commands
(such as  to abandon  ship) must  be written  out in  full.
Also,  in a few cases  two or more commands  begin with the
same letter,  and in  this  case that  letter refers  to  a
particular one  of the  commands! To  get the  other,  your
abbreviation must be two or more letters long.  This sounds
complicated,  but you will learn  the abbreviations quickly
enough.

What this all boils down to is
         (1)  you can abbreviate practically anything,
         (2)  if you forget, the computer will prompt you,
         (3)  or, you can type it all on one line.

If you  are part  way through  entering a  command and  you
change your mind, you can cancel the command by typing a -1
as one of the parameters.

If anything is not clear to you, experiment.  The worst you
can do is lose a game or two.


         ----------Descriptions of Commands----------



********************
* Short-Range Scan *
********************

    mnemonic:  SRSCAN
    shortest abbreviation:  SR
    full commands:  SRSCAN STATUS
                    SRSCAN

The short-range  scan gives  you a  considerable amount  of
information about  the  quadrant your  starship is  in.   A
short-range scan is best described by an example.

      1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
    1 * . . . . . . . . .  STARDATE      2516.3
    2 . . . E . . . . . .  CONDITION     RED
    3 . . . . . * . B . .  POSITION      5 - 1, 2 - 4
    4 . . . . . . . . . .  LIFE SUPPORT  DAMAGED, RESERVES=2.3
    5 . . . . . . . K . .  WARP FACTOR   5.0
    6 . K . . . . . . * .  ENERGY        2176.25
    7 . . . . . . . . . .  TORPEDOES     3

    9 . * . . * . . . C .  KLINGONS LEFT 12
   10 . . . . . . . . . .  TIME LEFT     9.26

The left  part is  a picture  of the  Quadrant.  The  E  at
sector 2 - 4 represents the Enterprise! The B at sector 3 -
8 is a Starbase. there are ordinary Klingons (K) at sectors
5 - 8 and 6 - 2,  and a Klingon Commander (C) at sector 9 -
9.  There  are  also  a large  number  of stars  (*).   The
periods (.) are just  empty space--they are printed to help
you get your bearings.

The  information   on   the   right  is   assorted   status
information. The status information will be present only if
you  type STATUS after  the word SRSCAN.  You  may also ask
for  status  information  only,  by  means  of  the  STATUS
command.

Short-range scans are free.  That is, they use up no energy
and  no time.   If you are  in battle,  doing a short-range
scan does not give  the Klingons another chance to hit you.
You can safely do a short-range scan anytime you like.



*****************
* Status Report *
*****************

    mnemonic:  STATUS
    shortest abbreviation:  ST

This command gives  you information about the current state
of your starship, as follows:

    STARDATE - the current date.  A stardate is the same as
		a day.

    CONDITION - there are four possible conditions:
         DOCKED - docked at Starbase.
         RED    - in battle.
         YELLOW - low on energy ( < 1000 units).
         GREEN  - none of the above.

    POSITION - Quadrant is given first, then sector.

    LIFE SUPPORT - if ACTIVE, life support systems are
         functioning normally.  If on RESERVES, the number
         is how many Stardates your reserve food, air, etc.
         will last--you must get repairs made or get to a
         Starbase before your reserves run out.

    WARP FACTOR - what your warp factor is currently set to.

    ENERGY - the amount of energy you have left.  If it
		drops to zero, you die.

    TORPEDOES - how many photon torpedoes you have left.

    SHIELDS - whether your shields are up or down, and how
		strong they are (what percent of a hit they
		can absorb).

    KLINGONS LEFT - how many of the enemy are still out there.

    TIME LEFT - how long the Federation can hold out against
		present number of Klingons, that is, how long
		until the end if you do nothing in the meantime.
		If you kill Klingons quickly, this number will go
		up, otherwise, it will go down.  If it reaches
		zero the Federation is conquered, and you lose.

Status information is free--it  uses no time or energy, and
if  you are in  battle, the Klingons are  not given another
chance to hit you.

Status  information  can   also  be  obtained  by  doing  a
short-range scan.  See the SRSCAN command for details.




*******************
* Long-Range Scan *
*******************

    mnemonic:  LRSCAN
    shortest abbreviation:  L

    a long-range scan gives you general information about where you
are and what is around you.  here is an example output.

         L. R. SCAN FOR QUADRANT 5 - 1
            -1  107  103
            -1  316    5
            -1  105  ***

This scan says that you are in row 5, column 1 of the 8 by 8
galaxy.  The numbers in the scan indicate how many of each
kind of thing there is in your quadrant and all adjacent
quadrants.  The digits are interpreted as follows.

    Hundreds Digit:   number of Klingons present
    Tens Digit:       number of Starbases present
    Ones Digit:       number of Stars present
       ***            indicates a supernova (only)

For example, in your quadrant (5 - 1) the number is 316, which
indicates 3 Klingons, 1 Starbase and 6 stars.  (The long-range
scanner does not distinguish between ordinary Klingons and
Klingon command ships.)  If there is a supernova, as in the
quadrant below and to your right (quadrant 6 - 2), there is
nothing else in the quadrant.

    Since you are in column 1, there are no quadrants to your
left.  The minus ones indicate the negative energy barrier at
the edge of the galaxy, which you are not permitted to try to
cross.

    Long-range scans are free.  They use up no energy or time,
and can be done safely regardless of battle conditions.




**************
* Star Chart *
**************

    mnemonic:  CHART
    shortest abbreviation:  CH

    As you proceed in the game, you learn more and more about
what things are where in the galaxy.  This information is
automatically recorded for you (by spock) in your star chart.

    The chart looks like an 8 by 8 array of numbers.  These
numbers are interpreted exactly as they are on a long-range
scan.  A period (.) in place of a digit means you do not know
that information yet.  For example, ... means you know nothing
about the quadrant, while .1. means you know that it contains
a base, but an unknown number of Klingons and stars.  Looking
at the star chart is a free operation.  It costs you neither 
time nor energy, and can be done safely whether in or out of battle.



*****************
* Damage Report *
*****************

    mnemonic:  DAMAGES
    shortest abbreviation:  DA

    At any time you may ask for a damage report to find out what
devices are damaged and how long it will take to repair them.
Naturally, repairs proceed faster at a starbase.

      If you suffer damages while moving, it is possible that a
subsequent damage report will not show any damage.  This happens
if the time spent on the move exceeds the repair time, since in
this case the damaged devices were fixed en route.

    Damage reports are free.  They use no energy or time, and can
be done safely even in the midst of battle.



*************************
* Move Under Warp Drive *
*************************

    mnemonic:  MOVE
    shortest abbreviation:  M
    full command:  MOVE <course> <distance>

    This command is the usual way to move from one place to
another within the galaxy.  You move under warp drive, according
to the current warp factor (see "warp factor").  The <course> in
which you move must be given as a number from 0 to 12, inclusive,
as on a clock face.  The <distance> you move is measured in
quadrants! A move of one sector is a distance of 0.1 quadrants.

    It uses time and energy to move.  How much time and how much
energy depends on your current warp factor, the distance you move,
and whether your shields are up.  The higher the warp factor, the
faster you move, but higher warp factors require more energy.
You may move with your shields up, but this doubles the energy
required.

    Each time you move in a quadrant containing Klingons, they
have a chance to attack you.  In this case, the "energy left"
message you get refers to your energy after the attack but before
the move.  As you move, the amount that the Klingons hit you with
is dependent on your average distance from them.  This is also
true if your move takes you out of the quadrant, when the Klingons
have one last chance to hit you.



***************
* Warp Factor *
***************

    mnemonic:  WARP
    shortest abbreviation:  W
    full command:  WARP <number>

    Your warp factor controls the speed of your starship.  The
larger the warp factor, the faster you go and the more energy
you use.

    Your minimum warp factor is 1.0 and your maximum warp factor
is 10.0 (which is 100 times as fast and uses 1000 times as much
energy).  At speeds above warp 6 there is some danger of causing
damage to your warp engines! This damage is larger at higher
warp factors and also depends on how far you go at that warp
factor.

    At exactly warp 10 there is some probability of entering a
so-called "time warp" and being thrown forward or backward in
time.  The farther you go at warp 10, the greater is the probability
of entering the time warp.


*******************
* IMPULSE ENGINES *
*******************

    mnemonic:  IMPULSE
    shortest abbreviation:  I
    full command:  IMPULSE <course> <distance>

    The impulse engines give you a way to move when your warp
engines are damaged.  They move you at a speed of 0.95 sectors
per stardate, which is the equivalent of a warp factor of about
0.975, so they are much too slow to use except in emergencies.

    <course> and <distance> are indicated just as in the "move"
command.

    The impulse engines require 20 units of energy to engage,
plus 10 units per sector (100 units per quadrant) travelled.
It does not cost extra to move with the shields up.



*********************
* DEFLECTOR SHIELDS *
*********************

    mnemonic:  SHIELDS
    shortest abbreviation:  SH
    full commands:  SHIELDS UP
                    SHIELDS DOWN

    Your deflector shields are a defensive device to protect you
from Klingon attacks (and nearby novas).  As the shields protect
you, they gradually weaken.  A shield strength of 75 percent, for
example, means that the next time a Klingon hits you, your shields
will absorb 75 percent of the hit, and let 25 percent get through
to hurt you.

    You may not fire phasers while your shields are up.  You may
fire photon torpedoes, but they may be deflected considerably from
their intended course as the pass through the shields (depending
on shield strength).

    Each time you raise or lower your shields, the Klingons have
another chance to attack.  Since shields do not raise and lower
instantaneously, the hits you receive will be intermediate between
what they would be if the shields were completely up or completely
down.

    It costs 50 units of energy to raise shields, nothing to lower
them.  you may move with your shields up! this costs nothing extra
under impulse power, but doubles the energy required for warp
drive.


***********
* PHASERS *
***********

    mnemonic:  PHASERS
    shortest abbreviation:   PHA
    full commands:   PHASERS AUTOMATIC <amount to fire>
                     PHASERS <amount to fire>
                     PHASERS MANUAL <amount 1> <amount 2> ... <amount n>

    Phasers are energy weapons.  As you fire phasers at Klingons,
you specify an <amount to fire> which is drawn from your energy
reserves.  It takes about 200 units total hit (plus or minus a
random amount) to kill an ordinary Klingon, or about 600 units
total hit (plus or minus a random amount) to kill a Klingon
commander.  Hits on Klingons are cumulative.

    In general, not all that you fire will reach the Klingons.
The farther away they are, the less phaser energy will reach them.
If a Klingon is adjacent to you, he will receive about 90 percent
of the phaser energy directed at him! a Klingon 5 sectors away
will receive about 60 percent, and a Klingon 10 sectors away will
receive about 35 percent.  There is some randomness involved, so
these figures are not exact.  Phasers have no effect beyond the
boundaries of the quadrant you are in.

    If phaser firing is automatic, the computer decides how to
divide up your <amount to fire> among the Klingons present.  If
phaser firing is manual, you specify how much energy to fire at
each Klingon present (nearest first), rather than just specifying
a total amount.  You can abbreviate "manual" and "automatic" to
one or more letters! If you mention neither, automatic firing is
usually assumed.

    A safety interlock prevents phasers from being fired while
shields are up.  If this were not so, the shields would contain
your fire and you would fry yourself.

    Phasers have no effect on starbases (which are shielded) or
on stars.


********************
* PHOTON TORPEDOES *
********************

    mnemonic:  PHOTONS
    shortest abbreviation:  PHO
    full commands:  PHOTONS <course> <burst angle>
                    PHOTONS <course> YES <burst angle>
                    PHOTONS <course> NO

    Photon torpedoes are projectile weapons--you either hit what
you aim at, or you don"t.  There are no "partial hits".

    One photon torpedo will usually kill one ordinary Klingon,
but it usually takes about two for a Klingon commander.  Photon
torpedoes can also blow up stars and starbases, if you aren"t
careful.

    You may fire photon torpedoes in a burst of three.  In this
case the <course> you specify refers to the middle torpedo of
the burst, and the <burst angle> is the amount which should be
added to and subtracted from the <course> to get the courses of
the other two torpedoes.  Burst angles may be from 0.05 to 0.5 .
The optional word "yes" explicitly indicates you want a burst!
The word "no" indicates you just want a single torpedo instead
of a burst.

    Photon torpedoes cannot be aimed precisely--there is always
some randomness involved in the direction they go.  Photon
torpedoes may be fired with your shields up, but as they pass
through the shields they are randomly deflected from their
intended course even more.

    While the strength of photon torpedos does not diminish with
distance, they are only effective within the quadrant! They have
no effect on things in adjacent quadrants.



********************
* DOCK AT STARBASE *
********************

    mnemonic:  DOCK
    shortest abbreviation:  DO

    You may dock your starship whenever you are in one of the
eight sector positions immediately adjacent to a starbase.  When
you dock, your starship is resupplied with energy, photon
torpedoes, and life support reserves.  Repairs also proceed
faster at starbase, so if some of your devices are damaged,
you may wish to stay at base (by using the "rest" command)
until they are fixed.

    Starbases have their own deflector shields, so you are
completely safe from attack while docked.  You are also safe
from long-range tractor beams.


************
* COMPUTER *
************

    mnemonic:  COMPUTER
    shortest abbreviation:  CO
    full command:  COMPUTER <sub-system name> <parameters>...

    The computer has four different sub-systems; navigation,
warp, time, and energy. each sub-system uses different parameter sets
than the others.

    To find the <course> (as in "move","impulse", and "photon") and
distance, use sub-system "navigation" ("n" is good) with parameters;
<sector-x>(down) <sector-y>(over) and (optionaly) <quadrant-x>(down)
<quadrant-y>(over).  If <quadrant-x> and <quadrant-y> are left off,
current quadrant is assumed.  Note: the reason sector comes first (as
apposed to the status and long-range sensors output of "quadrant -
sector") is to make it easier for course calculations on photon
torpedoes.

    To find required <warp-factor> for a specific expenditure of
distance and stardates, use sub-system "warp", with parameters
<distance> and <stardates>.

    To find <stardates> use "time", with parameters <distance> and
<warp-factor>.

    To find <energy-units> required to move somewhere, use <energy>,
with parameters <distance> <warp-factor> with shields <up>/<down>.

    If you type just "computer" with no sub-system, it will
respond with "%-working- ".  Then you may type in the sub-system you
wish to use (with the proper parameters, else it will ask for them).
After you finish with that sub-system it will again return with
"%-working- ", to which you may type another sub-system or just
a carriage-return to return to "command-".

    The computer can become damaged in battle, just like any other
device, so don't become dependent on its use or you may be rendered
helpless without it.



********
* REST *
********

    mnemonic:  REST
    shortest abbreviation:  R
    full command:  REST <number of stardates>

    This command simply allows the specified number of stardates
to go by.  This is useful if you have suffered damages and wish
to wait until repairs are made before you go back into battle.

    It is not generally advisable to rest while you are under
attack by Klingons.
**************************
* CALL STARBASE FOR HELP *
**************************

    mnemonic:  HELP
    shortest abbreviation:  H

    When you get into serious trouble, you may call starbase for
help.  Starbases have a device called a "long-range transporter
beam" which they can use to teleport you to base.  This works by
dematerializing your starship at its current position and (hopefully)
re-materializing it adjacent to the nearest starbase.  Teleportation
is instantaneous, and starbase supplies the required energy--all you
have to do is let them know (via subspace radio) that you need help.

    This command should be employed only when absolutely necessary.
In the first place, calling for help is an admission on your part
that you got yourself into something you cannot get yourself out
of, and you are heavily penalized for this in the final scoring.
Secondly, the long-range transporter beam is not reliable--starbase
can always manage to dematerialize your starship, but (depending
on distance) may or may not be able to re-materialize you again.
The long-range transporter beam has no absolute maximum range!
If you are in the same quadrant as a starbase, you have a good
chance (about 90 percent) of re-materializing successfully.
Your chances drop to roughly 50-50 at just over 3 quadrants.



****************
* ABANDON SHIP *
****************

    mnemonic:  ABANDON
    shortest abbreviation:  A

    You may abandon the enterprise if necessary.  If there is
still a starbase in the galaxy, you will be sent there and put
in charge of a weaker ship, the faerie queene.

    The faerie queene cannot be abandoned.


*****************
* SELF-DESTRUCT *
*****************

    mnemonic:  DESTRUCT
    shortest abbreviation:  DE

    You may self-destruct, thus killing yourself and ending the
game.  If there are nearby Klingons, you may take a few of them
with you (the more energy you have left, the bigger the bang).

    In order to self-destruct you must remember the password you
typed in at the beginning of the game.



******************************
* TERMINATE THE CURRENT GAME *
******************************

    mnemonic:  TERMINATE
    shortest abbreviation:  T

    Immediately cancel the current game.  No conclusion is reached
and no score is computed.  You will be given an opportunity to
start a new game or to leave the star trek program.



**********
* FREEZE *
**********

    mnemonic:  FREEZE
    shortest abbreviation:  F
    then: <file name>

    The purpose of the <freeze> command is to allow a player
to save the current state of the game, so that it can be finished
later.  A local file with the specified <file name> is created
(if necessary) and rewound, and all pertinant information about
the game is written to that file.  The game may then continue as
usual, or be terminated, at the user"s option.

    Users with permanent files may, of course, save the created
local file for later use.

    To restart a game created by the "freeze" command, the user
need only type "frozen" in response to the initial question
about the type of game desired, followed by the <file name>.

    Note:  a "tournament" game is like a frozen game, with the
following differences.  (1)  Tournament games always start from
the beginning, while a frozen game can start at any point.
(2)  Tournament games require only that the player remember the
name or number of the tournament, while the information about a
frozen game must be kept on a file.


                    ----------scoring----------

    Scoring is fairly simple.  You get points for good things, and
you lose points for bad things.

You gain--
    (1)  10 points for each ordinary Klingon you kill,
    (2)  50 points for each commander you kill.
    (3)  500 times your average Klingon/stardate kill rate.  If you
              lose the game, your kill rate is based on a minimum of
              5 stardates.
    (4)  you get a bonus if you win the game, based on your rating:
              novice=100, fair=200, good=300, expert=400.

You lose--
    (5)  200 points if you get yourself killed,
    (6)  100 points for each starbase you destroy,
    (7)  100 points for each starship you lose,
    (8)  100 points for each time you had to call for help,
    (9)  5 points for each star you destroyed, and
   (10)  1 point for each casualty you incurred.

    In addition to your score, you may also be promoted one grade
in rank if you play well enough.  Promotion is based primarily on
your Klingon/stardate kill rate, since this is the best indicator
of whether you are ready to go on to the next higher rating.
However, if you have lost 100 or more points in penalties, you
will not receive a promotion.

    You can be promoted from any level.  There is a special promotion
available if you go beyond the "expert" range.

You should probably start out at the novice level, even if you
are already familiar with one of the other versions of the STAR TREK
game--but, of course, the level of game you play is up to you.  If
you want to start at the expert level, go ahead.  It's your funeral.

Courses are given as on a clock face, with 12 or 0 at the top.
Distances are given in quadrants.  a distance of one sector is
    exactly 0.1 quadrant.
Ordinary Klingons have about 400 units of energy, commanders about
    1200.  phaser fire diminishes to about 60 percent at 5 sectors.
Warp 6 is the fastest safe speed.  at higher speeds, engine damage
    may occur.  at warp 10 you may enter a time warp.
Shields cost 50 units of energy to raise, and double the power
    requirements of moving under warp drive.
Warp drive requires (distance)*(warp factor cubed) units of energy
    to  travel at a speed of (warp factor squared)/10 quadrants per
    stardate.
Impulse engines require 20 units to warm up, plus 100 units per
    quadrant.  speed is just under one sector per stardate.


              ----------Acknowledgments----------


The authors would like to thank professor Michael Duggan for
his encouragement and administrative assistance with the development
of the star trek game, without which it might never have been
completed.

    Much credit is due to patrick mcgehearty and rich cohen, who
assisted with the original design of the game and contributed
greatly to its conceptual development.

    Thanks are also due to Carl Strange, hardy tichenor and steven
bruell for their assistance with certain coding problems.

    This game was inspired by and rather loosely based on an earlier
game, programmed in the basic language, by jim korp and grady hicks.
It is the authors' understanding that the basic game was in turn
derived from a still earlier version in use at Penn State University.
