Allthough 4.0 meg is not supported by any monitor other than 6.1 (which
is in field test) the following patch is needed by anyone attempting to
run  with  4.0  meg in their monitor (which i imagine some of you might
be).

The  following  patch  is  required by any site running with 4.0 meg of
memory. Disk IO to the last possible physical page of memory will cause
an ILLGO. Guess what hardware the monitor group just got?
